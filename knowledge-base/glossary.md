# Glossary of Zero-Knowledge Proof Terms

This is a reference glossary for AI coding agents working on zero-knowledge proof projects. It provides concise definitions of key terms, cryptographic primitives, proof systems, and related concepts encountered in ZK development. Use this document to quickly look up terminology when reading or generating ZK-related code, documentation, or architecture decisions.

**Circle STARKs** -- A STARK variant operating over the circle group of a Mersenne prime field, enabling efficient FFTs without requiring smooth-order multiplicative subgroups.

**Circuit** -- A representation of a computation as a network of mathematical operations over a finite field. Not an electrical circuit -- a mathematical one.

**Commitment scheme** -- A cryptographic method that lets you "seal" a value in an envelope, later proving properties about it without opening it. The four main families are KZG, FRI, IPA, and lattice-based (Ajtai).

**CycleFold** -- An engineering optimization that delegates the non-native scalar multiplication in folding schemes to a co-processor circuit on a secondary curve, reducing overhead.

**Data availability (DA)** -- The guarantee that transaction data is published and accessible so that anyone can reconstruct state and verify proofs independently.

**Goldilocks field** -- A specific 64-bit prime ($2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$). Called "Goldilocks" because it fits in a single machine word for fast arithmetic.

**Groth16** -- The most compact zero-knowledge proof system: proofs are exactly 192 bytes. Requires a per-circuit trusted setup ceremony.

**Halo 2** -- A PLONK-family proof system developed by the Electric Coin Company. The original Halo used IPA commitments (no ceremony); Halo 2 as deployed typically uses KZG commitments.

**HyperNova** -- A folding scheme by Kothapalli and Setty that generalizes Nova from R1CS to CCS using the sumcheck protocol, enabling folding of any constraint system.

**ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)** -- The fundamental language a processor understands. RISC-V is the dominant ISA for zero-knowledge virtual machines.

**IVC (Incrementally Verifiable Computation)** -- A framework for proving that a sequence of computation steps was performed correctly, where each step's proof implicitly covers all previous steps.

**KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg)** -- A polynomial commitment scheme producing constant-size proofs (~48 bytes) using elliptic curve pairings. Requires a trusted setup. Not quantum-resistant.

**Lattice** -- A regular grid of points in high-dimensional space. Finding a short vector in such a lattice is believed to be hard even for quantum computers.

**M31 / Mersenne-31** -- A 31-bit prime field ($2^{31} - 1$) used by Circle STARKs and Stwo. Its circle group has order $2^{31}$, enabling efficient radix-2 FFTs.

**Merkle tree** -- A pyramid-shaped data structure where a single hash at the top summarizes an entire collection, and membership can be proven with a short path of hashes.

**MSM (Multi-Scalar Multiplication)** -- A computation where many elliptic curve points are multiplied by different scalars and summed. Highly parallelizable on GPUs.

**Neo** -- A lattice-based folding scheme by Nguyen and Setty that adapts HyperNova's CCS folding to small fields (Goldilocks) with Ajtai commitments, introducing pay-per-bit commitment costs.

**Nova** -- The first practical folding scheme, by Kothapalli, Setty, and Tzialla (2022). Introduced relaxed R1CS and reduced the per-step overhead of IVC by orders of magnitude.

**NTT (Number Theoretic Transform)** -- The finite-field version of the Fast Fourier Transform. A critical bottleneck in modern proof systems.

**Nullifier** -- A cryptographic value derived from a secret key and a commitment, used to prevent double-spending in privacy-preserving systems without revealing the spender's identity.

**PLONKish** -- The arithmetization format used by PLONK and variants. Uses selector columns for different gate types plus copy constraints for wiring.

**Post-quantum (PQ)** -- Resistant to attacks by quantum computers. Hash-based and lattice-based cryptography are believed to be PQ. Elliptic curve cryptography is not.

**Proof aggregation** -- Combining multiple proofs into a single proof that is cheaper to verify than checking each proof individually. A key technique for amortizing on-chain verification costs.

**Prover** -- The entity that generates a zero-knowledge proof. In the magician metaphor, the prover is the magician who performs the trick.

**R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System)** -- The simplest constraint system format. The "assembly language" of arithmetization. Used natively by Groth16.

**Relaxed R1CS** -- A generalization of R1CS ($\mathbf{A}\mathbf{z} \circ \mathbf{B}\mathbf{z} = u \cdot \mathbf{C}\mathbf{z} + \mathbf{E}$) that introduces a scalar $u$ and error vector $\mathbf{E}$, enabling two instances to be combined via random linear combination. The key enabler of folding.

**RISC-V** -- An open, royalty-free instruction set architecture. Eight of ten major zkVMs use RISC-V as their target.

**Rollup** -- A blockchain scaling technique that executes transactions off the main chain, posting a compact proof back for verification.

**Sumcheck protocol** -- An interactive proof protocol (1992) that reduces verifying a sum over an exponentially large domain to checking a single evaluation. The backbone of modern ZK proof systems.

**TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)** -- A hardware-isolated secure enclave (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) that processes data in a protected region even the hardware operator cannot inspect.

**UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)** -- A model where each digital coin is a discrete object created by one transaction and consumed by another, like physical bills in a wallet.

**Verifier** -- The entity that checks a zero-knowledge proof. In the magician metaphor, the verifier is the audience that renders the verdict.
