# Trust Decomposition and System Architecture

This document synthesizes the manuscript’s seven-layer thesis into architectural patterns, three deployment paths, and a causal web of trust assumptions.

## The Binary That Broke

For three years, the zero-knowledge community organized its world along a single axis: SNARK or STARK. Trusted setup or transparent. Small proofs or big ones. Algebraic elegance or hash-based brute force. Every conference talk, every investor pitch, every architectural decision began with this fork in the road.

That binary is dead.

It did not die because one side won. It died because the winning move turned out to be using both sides simultaneously -- and then a third path appeared that neither side had anticipated. This is the story of how a two-path map became a three-path map, and why the seven-layer model from earlier in this book must bend to accommodate what actually happened.

## The Map Redrawn

Chapter 1 presented seven layers as a stack -- neat, linear, one resting on the next. Nine chapters of evidence say otherwise. The seven layers are a directed acyclic graph with fourteen causal edges, and we owe you the honest picture before proceeding.

  ── ► Upward chain (6 edges): 6→5→4→3→2→1 (design flows up)
  ◄ ── Downward pressure (8 edges): 7→6, 7→5, 4→2, 3≡4,
       6→7, 1→5, 5→7, 2→3
```

**Reading the diagram.** The upward chain (six edges) is what the book has followed: field choice (Layer 6) determines commitment scheme (Layer 5), which shapes arithmetization (Layer 4), which constrains witness layout (Layer 3), which influences ISA design (Layer 2), which determines setup scope (Layer 1). If this were the whole story, the stack metaphor would suffice.

It is not the whole story. Eight downward and cross-cutting edges complicate the picture. Ethereum gas economics (Layer 7) force BN254 pairings (Layer 6) and STARK-to-SNARK wrapping (Layer 5). Cairo's constraint system (Layer 4) dictated its ISA design (Layer 2). Jolt fused witness generation (Layer 3) into arithmetization (Layer 4). The graph has no cycles -- design-time constraints are asymmetric -- but it has width: multiple independent paths connect the same pair of nodes, and a single parameter change propagates through the web along all of them simultaneously.

The three paths below are routes through this DAG, not floors in a building. Each path makes different choices at each node, and the edges explain why those choices are coupled.

## Path One: The Hybrid STARK-to-SNARK Pipeline

The dominant production pattern in 2026 is not SNARK. It is not STARK. It is STARK *wrapped in* SNARK.

Here is how the trick works. A prover generates a STARK proof -- transparent, no trusted setup, post-quantum by construction, but large (50-200 KB) and expensive to verify on-chain (1-5 million gas on Ethereum). This STARK proof is then compressed through recursive aggregation and finally wrapped in a Groth16 SNARK proof -- tiny (192 bytes), cheap to verify on-chain (~250-300K gas), but requiring a trusted setup ceremony (the Powers-of-Tau).

Think of it as a two-act show. In the first act, the magician performs behind a glass wall -- everything is transparent, no trapdoors, no hidden compartments. In the second act, the performance is photographed, and the photograph is sealed in a tamper-proof envelope small enough to slip under a door. The audience in the theater (the blockchain) only sees the envelope. But anyone who opens it can verify that it faithfully captures the transparent performance.

Every major production system does this or plans to. SP1 Hypercube generates multilinear STARK proofs over the BabyBear field, recursively compresses them, then wraps the result in Groth16 over BN254 for Ethereum verification. Stwo generates Circle STARK proofs over the Mersenne-31 field, aggregates them via SHARP, then wraps to Groth16 via Herodotus for Ethereum settlement. RISC Zero, Airbender, ZisK, Pico Prism -- all follow the same pattern. Even StarkWare, the company that built its identity on transparent proving, wraps to Groth16 for Ethereum L1 because the gas economics demand it.

The wrapping pipeline is not a Layer 5 phenomenon. It pierces three layers simultaneously: Layer 5 (the proof system switches from STARK to SNARK), Layer 6 (the field transitions from BabyBear or M31 to BN254), and Layer 7 (the verification target shifts from prover-internal consistency to EVM smart contract). This vertical shaft through the stack is invisible in the original framing, which treats STARKs and SNARKs as competing alternatives occupying the same layer.

Why did this happen? Economics. Pure and simple. A raw STARK verification costs 1-5 million gas on Ethereum -- roughly $5-$25 at typical gas prices. A Groth16 verification costs ~250K gas -- roughly $0.50-$1.00. When you amortize this across thousands of transactions per batch, the difference is enormous. The inner STARK gives you transparency and post-quantum readiness. The outer SNARK gives you on-chain affordability. The combination gives you both.

The hybrid path has a structural weakness that deserves a name: the outer Groth16 wrapper is not post-quantum. Even though the inner STARK is quantum-resistant, the final on-chain verification depends on BN254 pairings, which Shor's algorithm breaks in polynomial time. The chain of trust is only as strong as its weakest link. Today's hybrid systems are transparent and fast on the inside, but they inherit quantum vulnerability from their verification wrapper. The glass wall is strong. The envelope has an expiration date.

## Path Two: Pure Transparent

The Ethereum Foundation has staked a different position. For the L1 zkEVM -- the project to prove every Ethereum block in zero knowledge -- the mandate is explicit: no trusted setup, period. This is not a preference; it is a requirement. The reasoning is straightforward: Ethereum's base layer cannot depend on a trusted ceremony that quantum computers will eventually break. The stage must be made of glass, all the way down.

This mandate forces a different engineering path. Pure transparent systems use only hash-based commitments (FRI, Merkle trees) and avoid all pairing-based cryptography. The cost is larger proofs and more expensive on-chain verification. The benefit is that no ceremony is ever needed, no toxic waste exists, and the security assumptions survive quantum computing (assuming hash functions with sufficient output size).

The EF's December 2025 pivot is instructive. Having declared the speed race "effectively won" -- four teams proved >99% of Ethereum blocks within the 12-second slot time -- the Foundation shifted its 2026 targets to security: 100-bit provable security by May 2026, 128-bit by December 2026. The new primary metric is energy consumption per proof (kWh), not raw speed. The Foundation explicitly rejects reliance on unproven mathematical conjectures (proximity gap assumptions) for production soundness.

This matters because it validates a specific engineering philosophy: formal provable security over empirical performance. SP1 Hypercube already eliminates proximity gap conjectures in its multilinear STARK. The EF's security-first stance means that systems with strong formal guarantees will be preferred for the most security-critical application in the ecosystem -- proving the base layer itself.

Brevis's Pico Prism occupies an interesting position on this path. Built on Plonky3 with hash-based FRI commitments, it achieves 99%+ real-time proving on 16 RTX 5090 GPUs while remaining fully transparent. For non-Ethereum-L1 applications that still need on-chain verification, it wraps to Groth16 -- but the inner pipeline is transparent end to end.

## Path Three: Post-Quantum Folding

The third path is the newest and least traveled. It abandons both pairing-based cryptography and hash-based commitments in favor of lattice-based constructions that provide additive homomorphism (enabling folding), post-quantum security, and increasingly competitive proof sizes.

The key systems are LatticeFold (Boneh & Chen, ASIACRYPT 2025), LatticeFold+ (CRYPTO 2025), Neo/SuperNeo (Nguyen & Setty, ePrint 2025/294), and Symphony (Chen, ePrint 2025/1905). These systems use Module-SIS commitments -- lattice-based structures whose hardness NIST has validated through the FIPS 203/204 standardization process -- to achieve folding over polynomial rings without relying on discrete logarithms or pairings.

The proof sizes are larger than Groth16 but rapidly improving: Greyhound (Nguyen & Seiler, CRYPTO 2024) achieves ~50 KB proofs with lattice-based commitments, and LaBRADOR (CRYPTO 2023) achieves ~58 KB. These are orders of magnitude larger than Groth16's 192 bytes but competitive with raw STARK proofs. The performance trajectory suggests that lattice-based schemes may reach practical production within 3-5 years.

Why does this path matter? Because it is the only path that survives quantum computing without any caveats. The hybrid path (Path One) is quantum-vulnerable at the verification wrapper. The pure transparent path (Path Two) relies on hash functions whose collision resistance degrades under quantum attack (SHA-256 drops from 128-bit classical to ~85-bit quantum collision resistance via the BHT algorithm). The lattice path relies on Module-LWE/SIS, which is believed to be quantum-resistant by design -- the same assumption family that NIST chose for its post-quantum standards. This path does not merely survive the quantum era. It was built for it.

The post-quantum folding path has a structural advantage that maps directly onto the Layer 6 analysis from Chapter 7. That chapter presented a trilemma: algebraic functionality, post-quantum security, and succinctness -- pick two. Lattice-based commitments provide additive homomorphism (enabling folding, which is a form of algebraic functionality), post-quantum security, and increasingly competitive succinctness. The trilemma is not being sidestepped; it is being actively compressed. Whether it can be fully dissolved remains an open question -- KZG's $O(1)$ proof size with full homomorphism has no post-quantum match yet. But the gaps are narrowing with each paper.

## The Three-Path Table

| Path | Setup | Inner Primitive | Outer Verification | PQ Status | Production Status |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Hybrid STARK-to-SNARK** | STARK inner (transparent) + Groth16 outer (trusted) | Hash-based FRI / Merkle | BN254 pairing (~250K gas) | Inner: quantum-safe; Outer: quantum-vulnerable | Dominant production default |
| **Pure Transparent** | Transparent only | Hash-based FRI, no pairings | Large on-chain proof or alternative verification | Quantum-safe (with sufficient hash output) | Ethereum L1 mandate; advancing |
| **Post-Quantum Folding** | Transparent (lattice-based) | Module-SIS commitments | Lattice verification (higher cost) | Quantum-safe by design | Research frontier; 3-5 year horizon |

## The Causal Web: Why It Is a DAG, Not a Stack

The book has presented seven layers as floors in a building -- stacked, with each resting on the one below. The evidence from Parts I and II tells a different story. The layers are not a stack; they are a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with bidirectional pressures. The building metaphor was useful for learning. Now we must complicate it.

The most consequential causal chain runs *upward* from Layer 6. Small-field primitives (BabyBear, M31) at Layer 6 enabled Circle STARKs and efficient multilinear proving at Layer 5, which enabled lookup-based and AIR-based arithmetization at Layer 4, which shaped shard-based witness generation at Layer 3, which favored RISC-V ISAs at Layer 2, and universal zkVMs amortized setup costs at Layer 1. The foundation shaped the building. That much the metaphor gets right.

But there are equally important *downward* pressures. The audience shapes the show:

**Layer 7 forces Layer 6.** Ethereum gas economics demand Groth16 verification, which requires BN254 pairings, which constrains the outer proof system. The verifier's economics shape the prover's cryptography. The audience's ticket price dictates the magician's technique.

**Layer 7 forces Layer 5.** STARK-to-SNARK wrapping exists because Ethereum's gas costs make raw STARK verification uneconomical. The verification layer forces a compression step that the proof system layer would not otherwise need.

**Layer 2 constrains Layer 4.** Cairo was designed so that its ISA minimizes arithmetization cost. The language was shaped by the constraint system, not the other way around. Layer 4 requirements propagated upward to shape Layer 2 design. The choreography was rewritten to fit the stage machinery.

**Layer 3 collapses into Layer 4.** In Jolt, witness generation *is* the arithmetization -- every instruction is decomposed into lookups on subtables. There is no meaningful boundary between "generate the trace" and "encode the computation."

The pedagogical ordering (Layer 1 first, Layer 7 last) follows the *data flow*: setup before language, language before witness, witness before proof. This is how a user encounters the system. But the *engineering causality* is inverted: the field choice at Layer 6 determines the commitment scheme, which determines the polynomial representation, which determines the arithmetization, which shapes everything above it.

These four examples are not anomalies. They are the norm. Once you catalog every causal arrow in the system, the picture that emerges is not a tower but a web -- and the web has a specific mathematical structure that is worth naming precisely.

### The Shape of the Web

Roger Penrose, in *The Road to Reality*, draws a distinction between structures that are merely complicated and structures that are *irreducibly entangled*. A stack is complicated: many parts, one ordering. A DAG is entangled: many parts, many orderings, no cycles. The seven-layer model, once you draw all the arrows, is a DAG with at least fourteen directed edges and zero cycles. It has structure, but that structure is not linear.

Consider the full edge set. Layer 6 forces Layer 5 (field choice determines commitment scheme). Layer 5 forces Layer 4 (commitment scheme shapes arithmetization). Layer 4 shapes Layer 3 (constraint format determines witness layout). Layer 3 shapes Layer 2 (witness cost influences ISA design). Layer 2 shapes Layer 1 (ISA scope determines setup complexity). That is the upward chain -- six edges, roughly linear, roughly matching the pedagogical ordering. If this were all, the stack metaphor would suffice.

But it is not all. Layer 7 forces Layer 6 (gas economics demand BN254). Layer 7 forces Layer 5 (verification cost forces wrapping). Layer 4 forces Layer 2 (constraint cost shapes ISA, as Cairo demonstrates). Layer 3 collapses into Layer 4 (Jolt's lookup singularity). Layer 6 forces Layer 7 (field size determines proof size, which determines verification cost). Layer 1 forces Layer 5 (setup type constrains which proof systems are available). Layer 5 forces Layer 7 (proof format determines verifier contract design). Layer 2 forces Layer 3 (ISA instruction count determines trace width).

That is fourteen edges among seven nodes. The graph has no cycles -- you cannot follow arrows from any node back to itself -- which is what makes it a DAG rather than a general directed graph. But the graph has *width*: multiple independent paths connect the same pair of nodes. Layer 6 reaches Layer 7 both directly (field determines proof size) and indirectly via Layer 5 (field determines proof system, which determines verifier). Layer 7 reaches Layer 5 both directly (gas cost forces wrapping) and indirectly via Layer 6 (gas cost forces BN254, which constrains proof system). These parallel paths are why changing a single parameter -- say, the base field -- propagates unpredictably through the stack. The change follows multiple routes, and those routes interfere with each other.

Penrose would recognize this as a feature, not a bug. Physical theories have the same structure: general relativity and quantum mechanics are not stacked but entangled, each constraining the other through multiple channels. The seven layers of zero-knowledge proofs exhibit the same irreducible entanglement. You cannot understand Layer 5 (the proof system) without simultaneously understanding Layer 6 (the field) and Layer 7 (the verifier). You cannot design Layer 2 (the ISA) without understanding Layer 4 (the constraint system). The system is not modular. It is coherent -- every part is connected to every other part through at most two hops.

### Why No Cycles?

The absence of cycles is not obvious and deserves explanation. Why can you not follow arrows from Layer 7 back to Layer 7?

The answer is that the arrows represent *design-time constraints*, not *runtime data flow*. At runtime, data flows in a rough circle: the user submits a transaction (Layer 2), which generates a witness (Layer 3), which is arithmetized (Layer 4), which is proved (Layer 5), which is verified (Layer 7), which triggers a state change that enables the next transaction (back to Layer 2). That loop is a cycle, and it is real. But the *design* constraints -- which architectural choices force which other architectural choices -- are acyclic. Choosing M31 at Layer 6 forces Circle STARKs at Layer 5, but choosing Circle STARKs at Layer 5 does not force M31 at Layer 6 (you could use any Mersenne prime). The arrows are asymmetric. The forcing goes one way.

This distinction -- cyclic runtime flow, acyclic design constraints -- explains why the seven-layer model is useful despite being wrong. The model captures the design-time DAG by projecting it onto a linear ordering. The projection loses information (it hides the downward and cross-cutting arrows) but preserves the acyclicity. A stack is the simplest DAG. The seven-layer stack is the simplest correct projection of the seven-layer web. It is a useful lie that points toward a more interesting truth.

A seven-layer model that acknowledges this bidirectionality is more accurate than one that implies simple top-down dependency. The layers are aspects of a single integrated system, not modules with clean interfaces. The magician, the stage, and the audience are not separable. They are one show.

## Trust Decomposition: Seven Weaker Assumptions

Now we arrive at the heart of the matter.

Everything in this book has been building toward this section. The seven layers, the three paths, the proof core, the causal DAG -- all of it converges on a single observation, and it is the most important thing this book has to say.

A traditional financial system requires trusting a single institution. The bank holds your money, knows your balance, controls your transactions, and you trust that it will behave honestly. You trust *one entity* with *everything*.

Zero-knowledge proofs do not eliminate trust. They do something different. They *decompose* it. They shatter a single monolithic trust assumption into seven independent, weaker assumptions. And because the assumptions are independent, no single failure breaks the system. This is not trustlessness. It is something better: trust that is distributed, auditable, and replaceable.

Here are the seven assumptions, and each one is a thread you can pull:

**Layer 1**: At least one of N ceremony participants was honest (for trusted setups), or that hash functions are collision-resistant (for transparent setups). This is the trust in the stage itself -- that the mathematical parameters were generated fairly.

**Layer 2**: The circuit was correctly written and audited. The under-constrained circuit epidemic catalogued in Chapter 3 remains the dominant vulnerability class, and a bug here lets the prover prove false statements. This is the trust in the choreography: that the script describes the trick accurately.

**Layer 3**: The hardware running the prover does not leak the witness through side channels. Timing attacks on Zcash's Groth16 prover leaked transaction amounts with $R = 0.57$ correlation. Cache timing attacks on ZK-friendly hash functions (Poseidon, Reinforced Concrete) have been demonstrated in cloud environments. This is the trust in the backstage -- that no one can see behind the curtain through cracks in the wall.

**Layer 4**: The arithmetization correctly encodes the computation. If the translation from program to polynomial constraints is wrong, the proof system faithfully proves the wrong thing. This is the trust in the encoding -- that the mathematical puzzle accurately represents the trick.

**Layer 5**: The proof system is sound -- no efficient adversary can forge proofs. This depends on the Fiat-Shamir transform being correctly implemented (the Frozen Heart bug of 2022 affected three independent implementations simultaneously) and on the underlying interactive proof being sound. This is the trust in the seal -- that the certificate cannot be forged.

**Layer 6**: The mathematical hardness assumptions hold. Discrete logarithms are hard (or lattice problems are hard, or hash preimages are hard). These are conjectures, not theorems. Tower NFS improvements already reduced BN254's estimated security from ~128 bits to ~100 bits. This is the trust in mathematics itself -- the deepest assumption, and the one we have the least power to verify.

**Layer 7**: The governance structure will not override the cryptography. Most deployed ZK rollups are Stage 0 or Stage 1 on L2Beat's framework, meaning a multisig can override the proof system. The Beanstalk flash-loan governance attack ($182M, April 2022) and the Tornado Cash CREATE2 contract replacement (May 2023) demonstrate that governance can be exploited. This is the trust in the theater management -- that the people who run the venue will not rig the show.

### When Each Thread Snaps: Seven Failure Scenarios

The seven assumptions above are not hypothetical. Every one of them has failed, is failing, or will fail in a live system. Isaac Asimov once observed that the most exciting phrase in science is not "Eureka!" but "That's funny..." -- the moment when an assumption you did not know you were making turns out to be wrong. In zero-knowledge systems, "That's funny..." is the sound of money disappearing. Here is what each failure looks like in practice, what breaks, and -- critically -- what does *not* break.

**If Layer 1 fails (compromised setup):** An attacker who knows the toxic waste from a trusted setup ceremony can forge proofs of arbitrary statements. They can mint tokens from nothing, approve transactions that never happened, fabricate state transitions whole cloth. The terrifying property of this failure is its *invisibility*. A forged Groth16 proof is indistinguishable from a legitimate one -- both are 192 bytes, both pass the verifier, both look identical on-chain. No alarm fires. No anomaly appears in the logs. The counterfeiting is perfect by construction. This is why Zcash's Powers-of-Tau ceremony involved 87 independent participants across six continents -- the assumption is that at least one of them destroyed their toxic waste. If all 87 were compromised (through coercion, incompetence, or a coordinated state-level attack), the entire shielded pool would be silently forgeable. Note what does *not* break: the circuit logic (Layer 2) is still correct, the witness privacy (Layer 3) is still intact, the math (Layer 6) still holds. The stage was rigged, but the trick's choreography was genuine.

**If Layer 2 fails (buggy circuit):** The proof system faithfully proves a false statement. This is the most common failure mode in production, and the canonical example is Tornado Cash. A single missing constraint in Tornado Cash's withdrawal circuit allowed an attacker to generate valid proofs for withdrawals from deposits that never existed. The circuit was supposed to verify that a nullifier corresponded to a real deposit commitment in the Merkle tree. A missing range check meant the prover could satisfy the constraints with fabricated values. The proof was *valid* -- it passed the verifier -- because the verifier only checks that the proof matches the circuit, and the circuit was wrong. The Zcash "InternalH" bug (CVE-2019-7167, February 2019) is the same species: a missing check in the Sapling circuit would have allowed unlimited counterfeiting of shielded ZEC. Found by a Zcash engineer during routine review, it was quietly patched before exploitation. The gap between "found by an auditor" and "found by an attacker" was a matter of months. Circom's under-constrained circuit epidemic -- where developers use the `<--` assignment operator instead of the `<==` constraining operator -- produces the same failure at industrial scale. The proof system is not broken. The program is broken. The seal is perfect; the document it seals is a forgery.

**If Layer 3 fails (witness leakage):** The zero-knowledge property evaporates. The proof is still valid, and the computation is still correct, but the secret inputs are exposed. The system proves the truth and simultaneously reveals what it was supposed to hide. Timing side-channel attacks on Zcash's Groth16 prover demonstrated this concretely: by measuring how long proof generation took, an observer could infer the transaction amount with $R = 0.57$ correlation. The proof said "this transaction is valid" without revealing the amount -- but the *time it took to generate the proof* leaked the amount through a side channel. In cloud proving environments (AWS, GCP), cache-timing attacks on ZK-friendly hash functions like Poseidon and Reinforced Concrete are even more direct: a co-located VM can observe memory access patterns and reconstruct the witness. This is a privacy catastrophe but not an integrity catastrophe. The computations are still correct. The proofs are still sound. But the magician's secrets are visible through cracks in the dressing room wall.

**If Layer 4 fails (incorrect arithmetization):** The constraint system does not faithfully represent the computation it claims to encode. This is subtler than a Layer 2 bug because the *program* may be correct -- the error is in the *translation* from program to polynomial constraints. Consider a zkVM that claims to prove RISC-V execution. If the arithmetization incorrectly encodes the behavior of, say, the `slt` (set-less-than) instruction -- treating signed comparison as unsigned, or failing to handle the overflow edge case at INT_MIN -- then the zkVM produces valid proofs of executions that never happened. The program was correct. The proof system was sound. The encoding between them was wrong. This failure is especially dangerous in hand-rolled constraint systems (pre-zkVM era), where a developer manually translates each operation into R1CS or AIR constraints. SP1's formal verification of all 62 RISC-V opcodes against the Sail specification exists precisely to prevent this class of failure. The trust is not in the magician or the seal, but in the translator standing between them -- and translators make mistakes.

**If Layer 5 fails (broken proof system):** An attacker can forge proofs without knowing the witness. The Frozen Heart vulnerability (2022) is the textbook case. Three independent implementations of the Fiat-Shamir transform -- Bellman (Zcash), Gnark (ConsenSys), and an academic reference -- all made the same mistake: they failed to bind the public inputs to the transcript hash. An attacker could take a valid proof for one statement and re-use it for a different statement. The proof said "I know a witness for X" but could be replayed to claim "I know a witness for Y." All three implementations were broken simultaneously, because all three misunderstood the same subtle requirement of the Fiat-Shamir transform. This is a soundness catastrophe. The seal can be forged. Valid-looking proofs can be manufactured for false statements. Unlike a Layer 2 failure (where the circuit is wrong but the proof system is honest), a Layer 5 failure means the proof system itself is compromised. Every proof it has ever generated becomes suspect.

**If Layer 6 fails (broken hardness assumption):** The mathematical foundation dissolves. This has not happened catastrophically yet, but it has happened incrementally, and incrementally is frightening enough. Tower NFS improvements reduced BN254's estimated security from approximately 128 bits to approximately 100 bits -- not a break, but an erosion. The 2023 lattice basis reduction advances by Ducas and van Woerden tightened the known attacks on NTRU lattices, and while they did not break any deployed scheme, they moved the boundary closer. A full break of BN254's discrete logarithm problem would compromise every Groth16 proof ever generated on that curve: past, present, and future. Every wrapped STARK-to-SNARK proof on Ethereum would be forgeable. Every ZK rollup using BN254 verification would lose its security guarantee retroactively. Shor's algorithm achieves exactly this for all pairing-based and elliptic-curve cryptography, given a sufficiently large quantum computer. The question is not *whether* this assumption will weaken but *when* and *how fast*. This is the failure that the post-quantum folding path (Path Three) exists to survive.

**If Layer 7 fails (governance override):** The cryptography is irrelevant because the humans in charge simply bypass it. This is the most prosaic failure and arguably the most dangerous, because it requires no mathematical sophistication -- only social engineering, legal coercion, or economic incentive. The Beanstalk flash-loan governance attack ($182M, April 2022) demonstrated the economic version: an attacker borrowed enough governance tokens to pass a malicious proposal in a single transaction, draining the protocol's treasury. The cryptography was never touched. The proofs were never forged. The governance mechanism -- the human layer above the math -- was the attack surface. The Tornado Cash CREATE2 replacement (May 2023) demonstrated the supply-chain version: the deployer address used CREATE2 to replace the governance contract with a malicious one, granting the attacker control over all locked funds. Again, no cryptographic break was needed. Most deployed ZK rollups operate with upgrade multisigs that can push new verifier contracts, effectively overriding any proof system guarantee. If three of five multisig holders collude (or are coerced by a state actor), they can deploy a verifier that accepts all proofs, or no proofs, or only proofs from approved provers. The mathematical fortress has a human door, and the door has a human lock.

### The Cascade Structure

Not all failures are created equal, and not all are independent. The seven assumptions form their own internal DAG of failure propagation.

A Layer 6 failure cascades into Layer 5 (if the hardness assumption breaks, the proof system built on it is unsound) and Layer 1 (if discrete logs are easy, trusted setup toxic waste can be reconstructed). But it does *not* cascade into Layer 2 (the circuit logic is still correct), Layer 3 (the witness generation is still private against non-quantum adversaries), or Layer 4 (the arithmetization is still faithful). A quantum computer that breaks BN254 makes Groth16 proofs forgeable, but it does not introduce bugs into Circom circuits. The choreography is fine. The seal is broken.

A Layer 2 failure is *contained*. A buggy circuit produces provably wrong results, but the proof system is still sound (it just proves the wrong thing), the setup is still valid, the hardware does not leak, and the math still holds. This containment is precisely what makes Layer 2 failures survivable: fix the circuit, redeploy the verifier, and the system recovers. The Zcash InternalH bug was patched in a single release. The stage machinery was fine; only the script needed rewriting.

A Layer 7 failure is the most isolated and the most devastating. It requires no interaction with any other layer. A governance override does not break the math, corrupt the circuit, or leak the witness. It simply ignores all of them. This isolation means that Layer 7 cannot be fixed by improving any other layer. Better proof systems, stronger fields, more rigorous audits -- none of these matter if a three-of-five multisig can replace the verifier contract. The only defense is the same defense that human institutions have always relied on: constitutional constraints, time-locks, social consensus, and the slow, unglamorous work of governance design.

The cascade structure reveals a counterintuitive truth about the seven-layer model. The *deepest* failures (Layer 6: math breaks) are the most catastrophic in scope but the least likely in practice. The *shallowest* failures (Layer 2: buggy circuit, Layer 7: governance override) are the most common in practice but the most recoverable. The threat landscape is inverted: the risks you encounter most often are the risks you can fix most easily. This inversion is what makes the trust decomposition genuinely useful. A monolithic trust model (trust the bank) gives you one failure mode: total. A decomposed trust model gives you seven failure modes, most of which are partial and recoverable. The system degrades gracefully, and graceful degradation is the definition of resilient engineering.

Each of these is independently falsifiable, independently auditable, and independently improvable. Breaking one does not necessarily break the others (though some failures cascade -- a quantum computer breaks Layers 1, 5, and 6 simultaneously for pairing-based systems). This decomposition is the genuine value proposition of zero-knowledge proofs: not trustlessness, but trust minimization through distribution.

Remember the bank from Chapter 1? The institution that holds your money, knows your balance, and controls your transactions? With zero-knowledge proofs, you no longer trust one bank with everything. You trust that at least one ceremony participant was honest. You trust that the circuit was correctly written. You trust that the hardware does not leak. You trust that the math is hard. You trust that the governance will not go rogue. Seven assumptions instead of one. Each weaker. Each testable. Each replaceable.

That is not a marketing slogan. It is a structural transformation.

## "Trustless" versus "Trust-Minimized"

The analysis concludes with a question that should be printed on the wall of every ZK team's office:

> If zero-knowledge proofs provide "trustless" computation, but the setup requires trusting ceremony participants (Layer 1), the program requires trusting the developer not to make constraint errors (Layer 2), the witness requires trusting the hardware not to leak side channels (Layer 3), the proof system requires trusting that mathematical hardness assumptions hold (Layer 6), and the verifier requires trusting that governance will not override the math (Layer 7) -- then where, exactly, is the "trustless" part?

The answer: nowhere. "Trustless" is a word that flatters the technology and misleads the user. Zero-knowledge proofs do not eliminate trust. They minimize and distribute it. Instead of trusting one bank with your financial data, you trust that: (a) at least one ceremony participant was honest, (b) the circuit was correctly written and audited, (c) the hardware is not leaking, (d) discrete logarithms are hard, and (e) the governance multisig will not go rogue.

Each of these is a weaker assumption than trusting a single entity. The combination is far more resilient than any single point of trust. But they are assumptions nonetheless, and a responsible guide to zero-knowledge proofs should catalog them explicitly.

We stated this thesis in the opening pages of Chapter 1: trust decomposition, not trust elimination. Ten chapters later, the decomposition is precise. Seven assumptions instead of one. Fourteen causal edges instead of a monolith. Three architectural paths, each with different failure profiles. The word "trustless" obscures every one of these distinctions. The word "trust-minimized" preserves them.

The remaining chapters of this book will use "trust-minimized" rather than "trustless." Not because it sounds better -- it sounds worse, deliberately -- but because it is accurate. And accuracy in naming things is where understanding begins.
