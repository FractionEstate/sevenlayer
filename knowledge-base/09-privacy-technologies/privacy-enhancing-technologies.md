# Privacy-Enhancing Technologies

This document compares zero-knowledge proofs with MPC, FHE, and differential privacy, focusing on composition patterns, security tiers, and system-design tradeoffs.

*"Privacy is not a feature you bolt on. It is a property of the architecture -- and if the architecture does not have it, no amount of cryptography will give it to you."*

---

This chapter makes a single argument: zero-knowledge proofs are necessary but not sufficient for privacy. A system that deploys ZKPs alone will leak through side channels, metadata, composition boundaries, and the gaps between what the proof covers and what the system exposes. The architect who reaches for ZKPs without understanding MPC, FHE, and differential privacy will build a house with a vault door on the front and a screen door on the back. Each technology in the PET family answers a different question. Understanding which question you are actually asking -- and which tool answers it -- is the prerequisite for any privacy architecture that works in practice.

We examine four technologies (ZKP, MPC, FHE, differential privacy), classify their security guarantees into three tiers (information-theoretic, computational, heuristic), study their composition patterns through five real-world deployments, and end with a decision matrix for system architects choosing between them.

## The Four Pillars

Zero-knowledge proofs are one member of a family. The family is called privacy-enhancing technologies -- PETs -- and understanding ZKPs without understanding their siblings is like watching a magician and concluding that all performance is sleight of hand. It is not. Some performers sing. Some dance. Some vanish entirely. And the best shows combine all of them.

There are four major PET categories that matter for system architects making decisions in 2026. Each answers a different question. Each has a different relationship to the stage.

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** answer: *How do I prove a statement about my private data without revealing the data itself?*

Think of ZKPs as the magician's core trick: the audience sees the result but not the method. "My balance exceeds the minimum." "I am over 18." "This computation was performed correctly." The key insight, often missed, is that ZKPs are a tool for *selective disclosure*, not blanket privacy. The proof reveals the *truth of the statement* -- which is itself information. Proving "my balance exceeds $1 million" tells you something about the balance, even though the exact figure stays hidden. The magician chooses which cards to reveal. That choice is itself a disclosure.

If ZKPs are the magician's core trick -- proving truth without revealing method -- then the three siblings each perform a different kind of magic.

**Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** answers: *How can multiple parties jointly compute a function on their combined data without any party revealing its input to the others?*

Picture three rival magicians who want to know whose trick is most popular -- but none will reveal their ticket sales to the others. MPC is the protocol that lets them compute the answer as if a trusted accountant had all the books, without any such accountant existing. The inputs stay private. Only the agreed-upon output is revealed.

MPC is not a single protocol. It is a family, and the family members have very different properties:

| Protocol Family | Trust Model | Security Type | Best For |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Shamir secret sharing | Honest majority (>50% honest) | Information-theoretic | Statistical computations, few parties |
| SPDZ (dishonest majority) | Any number of corruptions | Computational | Adversarial settings, financial computation |
| Garbled circuits | Two parties, semi-honest or malicious | Computational | Two-party computation |

The distinction between honest-majority and dishonest-majority protocols matters enormously. Shamir-based MPC with honest majority achieves *information-theoretic* security -- it remains secure even against an adversary with unlimited computational power, including quantum computers. SPDZ provides security against any number of corruptions, but relies on computational hardness assumptions.

To understand what MPC actually does, consider the problem that started the field. In 1982, Andrew Yao posed what is now called the Millionaires' Problem: two millionaires want to determine who is richer without either revealing their net worth. They are standing at a cocktail party. Neither will say a number. Neither trusts the other to be honest. And no accountant is available whom both would trust with the truth. How do they find out?

Here is the trick. Alice has a net worth of, say, $7 million. Bob has $5 million. Alice encodes her wealth into an encrypted lookup table -- a garbled circuit -- that represents the comparison function "is Alice's input greater than Bob's input?" She hands the garbled table to Bob. Bob, using a sub-protocol called oblivious transfer, obtains the encryption key corresponding to his own input ($5 million) without Alice learning which key he selected. Bob evaluates the garbled circuit with his key and obtains a single bit of output: "Alice is richer." He announces the result. Neither party learned the other's number. The function was computed. The inputs stayed private.

The garbled circuit deserves a moment of its own, because it is one of the most counterintuitive constructions in all of cryptography. Alice takes the computation she wants to perform and compiles it into a Boolean circuit -- AND gates, OR gates, NOT gates, the same primitives that make up a physical processor. She then encrypts every wire in the circuit with random labels: each wire gets two labels, one for "0" and one for "1," and Alice encrypts each gate's truth table so that only the correct pair of input labels decrypts to the correct output label. The result is a garbled mess -- a table of ciphertexts that encodes the computation but reveals nothing about it. Bob can evaluate the garbled circuit gate by gate, decrypting one entry per gate, following the circuit from input to output. He sees the computation unfold, but the labels are random strings. He learns the output and nothing else. Alice never sees Bob's input. Bob never sees Alice's circuit internals. The computation happens in a kind of cryptographic fog, visible only at the endpoints.

Scale this from cocktail-party curiosity to industrial infrastructure and the applications multiply. Private auctions: bidders submit encrypted bids to an MPC protocol that determines the winner and the clearing price without revealing any losing bid. The auction house learns who won and at what price. It never learns what the losers were willing to pay -- information that, in traditional auctions, the house can exploit in future rounds. Dark pool matching in finance: two investment banks want to match buy and sell orders for the same security without revealing their order books to each other or to the market. MPC lets them compute the intersection of their orders -- the trades that both sides want -- without exposing the orders that did not match. The matched trades execute. The unmatched orders remain invisible.

Private set intersection, or PSI, is the simplest and most widely deployed MPC primitive. Two parties each hold a set of items. They want to learn which items appear in both sets -- and nothing else. When COVID-19 contact tracing required matching infected individuals against location databases, PSI offered a path that did not require a central authority to hold everyone's location history. Google and Apple's Exposure Notification framework used a related technique: devices broadcast rotating pseudonymous identifiers, and the matching computation happens locally on each device. The computation is distributed. The data never congregates.

The cost of MPC is communication, not computation. Each gate in the circuit requires the parties to exchange encrypted values. For garbled circuits, this means transmitting roughly four ciphertexts per gate. A circuit with a billion gates requires transmitting billions of ciphertexts -- tens of gigabytes over the network. The computation itself is fast. The network is the bottleneck. This is why MPC shines for problems where the function is simple but the privacy requirement is absolute, and struggles for problems where the function is complex and latency matters. The magician works quickly. The postal service does not.

MPC is the ensemble performance: multiple magicians, each holding one card of a shared secret, jointly computing a result that none of them could produce alone. The audience sees the answer. No single performer ever sees the full hand.

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** answers: *How can I outsource computation on my data without the computing party learning anything about the data?*

Craig Gentry, who invented FHE, gave it the perfect image: performing surgery on a patient inside a sealed glovebox. The surgeon's hands are inside the gloves, manipulating the patient, but the glovebox prevents any direct contact. The surgeon can work -- she can cut, stitch, probe -- but she never touches the patient directly, and nothing from the operating field crosses the barrier. It is a vivid image from a different domain -- not our magician's stage but a laboratory -- and we borrow it here because Gentry's metaphor has become inseparable from the concept itself.

You encrypt your data. You send the ciphertext to a cloud provider. The cloud provider performs operations on the ciphertext. You decrypt the result. The cloud provider learns nothing -- not the data, not the result, not even which operations were meaningful. The gloves never come off.

But the glovebox is thick, and the gloves are stiff. Current FHE computations are 10,000x to 1,000,000x slower than their plaintext equivalents. Ciphertexts accumulate noise with each operation, requiring periodic "bootstrapping" that is computationally expensive. Not all operations are equally efficient -- additions and multiplications are the native operations, while comparisons and divisions are far more costly. The surgeon can work, but she works very, very slowly.

To understand why the gloves are so stiff, you need to see what an FHE computation actually looks like from the inside. The dominant schemes -- BFV, BGV, and CKKS -- all share a common mathematical structure. A plaintext value (say, the number 42) is encoded as a polynomial in a ring, typically $\mathbb{Z}_q[X]/(X^n + 1)$ for $n = 2^{13}$ or $2^{14}$ and $q$ a large modulus, perhaps 200 to 800 bits long. Encryption adds a carefully sampled noise term to this polynomial. The ciphertext is a pair of ring elements, each thousands of bits wide. Where a plaintext integer fits in 64 bits, its ciphertext might occupy 32 kilobytes. The glovebox is thick because the encoding is thick.

Addition through the glovebox is relatively gentle. You add two ciphertexts component-wise, and the noise terms add as well. The noise grows, but only linearly. Encrypted addition is perhaps 100x slower than plaintext addition -- expensive, but not prohibitively so.

Multiplication is where the cost explodes. When you multiply two ciphertexts, the underlying polynomial multiplication produces a result with noise that is roughly the *product* of the two input noise levels, not the sum. One multiplication might double the noise budget. Two multiplications might quadruple it. After a dozen consecutive multiplications without intervention, the noise overwhelms the signal -- the ciphertext becomes a random-looking polynomial that decrypts to garbage. The noise is not a flaw in the design. It *is* the security. Without noise, the lattice-based hardness assumptions that make FHE secure would not hold. The glovebox is thick because thinning it would make it transparent.

Gentry's breakthrough -- the idea that launched FHE from theoretical impossibility to practical research program -- was bootstrapping. The concept is recursive and almost paradoxical: to clean the noise from a ciphertext, you decrypt it *homomorphically*. That is, you take the noisy ciphertext, encrypt the decryption key under a fresh public key, and then run the decryption algorithm as a circuit *inside the encryption*. The output is a fresh ciphertext encrypting the same plaintext, but with reset noise -- as if you had just encrypted the value for the first time. The surgeon, working through the glovebox, performs a second surgery on the glovebox itself, replacing the foggy glass with a clean pane, all without ever removing her hands.

The cost of this cleaning step is enormous. A single bootstrapping operation might take 10 to 100 milliseconds on modern hardware -- which sounds fast until you realize that the plaintext operation it replaces (a single multiplication) takes about one nanosecond. The ratio is 10 million to one. And bootstrapping must be performed after every few multiplications to keep the noise below the fatal threshold. The 10,000x to 1,000,000x slowdown is not a single penalty applied once. It is the accumulated cost of performing every arithmetic operation on bloated polynomial ciphertexts and periodically cleaning the noise through a decryption-inside-encryption cycle that is itself a complex computation.

Recent optimizations have attacked every link in this chain. TFHE (Torus FHE) reduces the bootstrapping cost for Boolean circuits by working over a different algebraic structure. GPU acceleration parallelizes the polynomial ring arithmetic. Hybrid schemes use leveled FHE (no bootstrapping) for shallow circuits and switch to bootstrapping only when depth demands it. The overhead is shrinking -- from a million-fold five years ago to ten-thousand-fold today -- but the fundamental structure remains: encrypted computation is expensive because the noise that provides security must be managed, and managing it costs orders of magnitude more than the computation itself.

And here is the connection that brings us back to our magician. FHE lets you compute on encrypted data, but how do you know the computation was performed *correctly*? The cloud provider claims it evaluated your function honestly. But the output is encrypted -- you cannot inspect the intermediate steps. The provider could have computed a different function, or computed the right function incorrectly, and you would not know until you decrypted the result and found it nonsensical. Verifiable FHE -- zkFHE -- addresses this by having the computing party produce a zero-knowledge proof that the homomorphic operations were performed according to specification. The surgeon operates through the glovebox, and a camera inside the glovebox records the procedure for the review board. The patient stays sealed. The surgery is verified. This is where FHE and ZKPs converge, and it is one of the most active research frontiers in applied cryptography.

The field is improving rapidly. Zama, the leading FHE company, achieved a $1 billion valuation in June 2025 and launched the Confidential Blockchain Protocol testnet in July 2025. Their roadmap projects hundreds of transactions per second with GPU acceleration. But a 10,000x overhead, even if it shrinks to 1,000x, means FHE is practical only for computations where the privacy guarantee is worth the performance cost. The glovebox is for surgery you cannot perform any other way.

FHE is the trick performed inside a sealed box: the computation happens on encrypted data, and even the magician who executes the computation never sees the plaintext. The box opens to reveal only the result.

**Differential Privacy (DP)** answers: *How can I release statistical insights about a dataset while guaranteeing that no individual's record can be reverse-engineered from the output?*

If the other PETs are stage tricks -- precise, targeted, visible to the audience -- differential privacy is fog. It blurs the picture just enough that no individual face can be identified, while the overall scene remains recognizable. Apple uses it for iOS telemetry (since 2016, with $\varepsilon = 2$ per day for most data types). Google deployed RAPPOR (Randomized Aggregatable Privacy-Preserving Ordinal Response) for Chrome usage monitoring. The US Census Bureau used it for the 2020 Census -- the first-ever deployment at national scale, motivated by the Dinur-Nissim database reconstruction theorem, which proved that releasing too many exact statistics about a dataset inevitably leaks individual records.

DP works by adding carefully calibrated noise to query results. The noise is large enough to mask any individual's contribution but small enough to preserve the statistical utility of the aggregate. The privacy guarantee is parameterized by epsilon (lower epsilon = more privacy = more noise = less accuracy), and composability is formalized by a composition theorem: sequential queries consume a "privacy budget," and once the budget is exhausted, no more queries can be safely answered. The fog has a finite supply. Use it wisely.

The epsilon parameter deserves a longer look, because it is where the mathematics of differential privacy meets the politics of data collection. Think of epsilon as controlling the blur radius on a photograph. At $\varepsilon = 0.1$, you are looking at a Monet painting -- the water lilies are recognizable as water lilies, but individual petals dissolve into impression. The aggregate is preserved. The particular is lost. At $\varepsilon = 1$, you are looking at a photograph taken through frosted glass -- shapes and proportions are clear, but faces are unreadable. At $\varepsilon = 10$, you are looking at a photograph with a slight smudge -- almost everything is visible, and a determined adversary with auxiliary information might identify individuals. At $\varepsilon = \infty$, there is no blur at all. You are looking at the raw data.

The art of differential privacy is choosing the blur. Too much noise (low epsilon) and the data is useless -- a census that cannot distinguish New York from Nebraska serves no one. Too little noise (high epsilon) and the privacy guarantee is hollow -- a medical database that lets researchers reconstruct individual diagnoses is not private in any meaningful sense. The Dinur-Nissim theorem makes the stakes precise: for any dataset of $n$ individuals, if you answer more than $O(n)$ counting queries with accuracy better than $1/\sqrt{n}$, you can reconstruct the entire dataset. The blur is not optional. Without it, the data eventually gives up everyone's secrets.

What does this look like in practice? Apple's deployment adds noise locally, on each device, before data is transmitted -- a technique called local differential privacy. When your iPhone wants to report which emoji you use most frequently, it does not send "thumbs up." It sends "thumbs up" with probability $(e^\varepsilon)/(e^\varepsilon + 1)$ and a random emoji with probability $1/(e^\varepsilon + 1)$. Any individual report is plausibly random. But aggregate millions of reports, and the noise cancels out, revealing the population-level distribution. Apple uses $\varepsilon = 2$ per day for most data types and $\varepsilon = 8$ for some health-related queries. Google's RAPPOR uses a similar local model with a two-stage randomization that provides both plausible deniability for individual responses and high accuracy for aggregate statistics. You never see any of this. Your phone adds the noise silently, the aggregation server receives randomized data, and the statistical team extracts population trends from the collective fog.

The composition problem is the silent killer of differential privacy deployments. Each query against a dataset consumes a portion of the privacy budget. If you query a medical database once with $\varepsilon = 1$, you get a strong privacy guarantee. If you query it twice, the effective epsilon is (at most) 2 -- weaker, but still meaningful. If you query it a thousand times, each with $\varepsilon = 1$, the effective epsilon is (at most) 1000 -- and at that point, the privacy guarantee is essentially worthless. Advanced composition theorems (Dwork, Rothblum, and Vadhan, 2010) give tighter bounds: k queries with epsilon each compose to roughly $\varepsilon \cdot \sqrt{k}$ rather than $\varepsilon \cdot k$. But the fundamental truth remains: privacy budgets are finite, and every query spends them. A dataset that has been queried ten thousand times is not the same, from a privacy standpoint, as one that has been queried ten times. The fog dissipates with each question asked. The Census Bureau's TopDown Algorithm was designed with this in mind: the total privacy budget was fixed before any queries were defined, and the noise allocation was optimized across all geographic levels simultaneously, from national aggregates down to census blocks. The budget was spent once, carefully, and then the books were closed.

## Three Kinds of Security

These four technologies provide fundamentally different *types* of security guarantees, and conflating them leads to bad architecture decisions. This is the part where precision matters more than analogy.

**Information-theoretic security** means the guarantee holds even against an adversary with unlimited computational power. No mathematical breakthrough, no quantum computer, no advance in algorithms can break it. MPC with honest majority (e.g., Shamir secret sharing where more than half the participants are honest) achieves this. The security follows from information theory, not computational hardness. The caveats: you need an honest majority, and the communication cost scales with the number of parties and the complexity of the computation.

**Computational security** means the guarantee holds against adversaries bounded to polynomial-time computation. It rests on assumptions: "discrete logarithms are hard," "the Learning With Errors problem is hard," "the Ring-LWE problem is hard." ZKPs and FHE provide computational security. If the underlying hardness assumption falls -- as discrete logarithm will fall to Shor's algorithm on a sufficiently large quantum computer -- the security evaporates retroactively. Every proof ever generated under that assumption becomes suspect. The lock does not weaken. It ceases to exist.

**Heuristic security** means the guarantee rests on practical observations rather than formal proof. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel SGX, AMD SEV, and ARM CCA provide heuristic security. The hardware manufacturer attests that the enclave is isolated. But SGX has been broken by Spectre, Meltdown, Foreshadow, Plundervolt, SGAxe, and AEPIC Leak. AMD SEV has shown vulnerabilities (SEVered, CipherLeaks). Intel SGX was deprecated on consumer processors in 2021. The 2025 attacks Battering RAM (~50 euros) and Wiretap (~$1,000) demonstrated physical attacks at commodity prices. TEE security is real in practice against most adversaries, but it lacks the mathematical foundation of cryptographic privacy and carries an expiration date set by the next side-channel attack. It is a stage built from plywood rather than steel: functional, but not what you want for the long run.

The metaphor of plywood is generous. To understand TEEs concretely, picture a room within a room. Your CPU -- the physical chip on the motherboard -- creates an isolated memory region called an enclave. Code and data inside the enclave are encrypted in RAM. The operating system cannot read the enclave's memory. The hypervisor cannot read it. Even a system administrator with root access and physical possession of the machine cannot read it. The CPU itself enforces the boundary: any attempt to access enclave memory from outside the enclave returns encrypted garbage. Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) pioneered this architecture. ARM TrustZone implements a similar concept at the processor level, splitting the chip into a "secure world" and a "normal world" with hardware-enforced isolation between them.

The promise is strong: you can run sensitive computation on an untrusted machine, and the machine's owner cannot observe or tamper with it. Cloud computing without trusting the cloud. The allure is obvious. The history is cautionary.

Foreshadow (August 2018) broke SGX isolation through a speculative execution attack. The CPU's branch predictor, trying to execute instructions ahead of time for performance, would speculatively read enclave memory and leave traces in the L1 cache. An attacker could measure cache timing to reconstruct the enclave's secrets. The attack required no physical access -- it could be performed by a process running alongside the enclave on the same machine. Intel patched it with microcode updates, but the patch reduced performance and the fundamental vulnerability -- that speculative execution can leak secrets across security boundaries -- proved to be architectural, not incidental.

AEPIC Leak (August 2022) was worse. It exploited a bug in Intel's Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller to read stale data from the enclave's memory hierarchy. Unlike Foreshadow, which required careful cache timing, AEPIC Leak provided architecturally guaranteed data leakage -- the CPU would hand you the enclave's data directly if you asked the right hardware register. No timing side channel, no statistical analysis. A clean read.

Downfall (August 2023) exploited the Gather instruction, which loads data from scattered memory locations into a vector register. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to read data from other security domains -- including SGX enclaves -- by observing the contents of internal CPU buffers during Gather operations. Intel's mitigation involved disabling the optimization that made Gather fast, resulting in up to 50% performance degradation for workloads that depended on it.

Intel quietly deprecated SGX on consumer processors (12th generation and later) beginning in 2021. The feature remains available on server-class Xeon processors, where it is marketed for cloud confidential computing. But the deprecation on consumer chips tells a story: Intel concluded that the attack surface was too large and the performance cost of mitigations too high for a feature intended to run on every laptop. The room within a room is still available -- but only in the data center, where the threat model is different and the economic calculus favors the convenience of hardware isolation despite its known fragility.

For the system architect, this taxonomy matters because it determines *what you are actually trusting*. If your system uses MPC with honest majority for the core computation and ZKPs for the verifiable output, you have information-theoretic privacy for the computation and computational privacy for the proof. If you then run the whole thing inside a TEE, the TEE adds performance (fast) and convenience (no complex protocol choreography) but does not strengthen the privacy beyond what the cryptography already provides -- and may weaken it if the TEE is compromised.

The magician's guarantee depends on which lock protects the trick. Information-theoretic security is a lock that cannot be picked, even with infinite time. Computational security is a lock that cannot be picked in practice -- but a quantum locksmith might change the calculus. Heuristic security is a lock that has never been picked, without proof that it cannot be.

## Composability: When One PET Is Not Enough

The real power of PETs emerges when they are composed. No single instrument plays the whole symphony. Consider a realistic healthcare scenario -- and notice how each PET enters at the moment its particular strength is needed:

1. **Step 1 (MPC)**: Five hospitals jointly compute aggregate statistics on a rare disease using their combined patient records. Each hospital contributes its data to an MPC protocol. No hospital sees any other hospital's records. The output is aggregate statistics: prevalence rates, treatment outcomes, demographic distributions.

2. **Step 2 (Differential Privacy)**: Before the aggregate statistics leave the MPC computation, differential privacy noise is added. This ensures that even the aggregate output cannot be used to infer individual patient records. The privacy budget (epsilon) is tracked across queries.

3. **Step 3 (FHE)**: The differentially private aggregate statistics are encrypted under FHE. An AI firm trains a predictive model on the encrypted data. The AI firm never sees the plaintext statistics. The hospitals never see the AI firm's model architecture (which may be proprietary). The glovebox, again.

4. **Step 4 (ZKP)**: The AI firm produces a zero-knowledge proof that the trained model meets accuracy and fairness criteria specified in a regulatory standard, without revealing the model's weights or the training data. A regulator verifies the proof and certifies the model for clinical use. The magician performs. The audience -- in this case, the regulator -- verifies.

Each step uses the PET best suited to its specific trust problem: MPC for multi-party data aggregation, DP for statistical disclosure control, FHE for outsourced computation on sensitive data, and ZKP for verifiable compliance without disclosure.

But the transitions between steps are not trivial. The MPC-to-FHE handoff requires either the hospitals to encrypt the MPC output under the AI firm's FHE public key (which means they see the plaintext), or a protocol that converts MPC secret shares directly to FHE ciphertexts (an active research frontier). The FHE-to-ZKP handoff requires verifiable FHE -- proving in zero knowledge that an FHE computation was performed correctly -- which is emerging but not yet production-ready.

The composability lesson: PETs compose in theory. In practice, each composition point requires protocol engineering that is often harder than the individual PET deployments. The system architect must understand not just what each PET does, but how they hand off to each other. The orchestra sounds beautiful when everyone enters on cue. Getting the cues right is the hard part.

Three composition patterns deserve particular attention, because they recur across domains and will likely define the privacy architecture of the next decade.

**ZKP + MPC: Verified Inputs to Joint Computation.** The healthcare scenario above assumes each hospital contributes honest data to the MPC protocol. But what if a hospital submits fabricated records -- inflating its patient count to increase its share of research funding, or omitting records to conceal a malpractice pattern? MPC computes correctly on whatever inputs it receives. It does not verify that the inputs are truthful. This is where ZKPs enter: each participant produces a zero-knowledge proof that its MPC input satisfies agreed-upon constraints -- the records come from a certified database, the patient count matches a signed attestation from the hospital's electronic health record system, the data format conforms to the protocol specification. The MPC protocol verifies these proofs before accepting the inputs. The joint computation proceeds on data that is both private *and* certified. No party reveals its data. Every party proves its data is legitimate. The magician does not merely perform behind a curtain -- she presents her credentials before stepping onto the stage.

This pattern -- ZKP-verified inputs to MPC -- appears in private auctions (prove your bid is backed by sufficient funds without revealing the bid amount), in private voting (prove you are an eligible voter without revealing your identity), and in collaborative machine learning (prove your training data meets quality thresholds without revealing the data itself). In each case, MPC provides the privacy during computation, and ZKPs provide the integrity of the inputs. The two PETs are not redundant. They address orthogonal trust problems. Privacy without integrity is a system that computes correctly on lies. Integrity without privacy is a system that reveals everything it verifies.

**ZKP + FHE: Verifiable Encrypted Computation.** This is the zkFHE frontier mentioned earlier, and it deserves a structural explanation. The problem: a cloud provider performs FHE computation on your encrypted data and returns an encrypted result. You decrypt and get an answer. But did the provider actually compute the function you requested? Or did it compute a cheaper approximation, or a different function entirely, or simply return a random ciphertext? FHE guarantees confidentiality -- the provider cannot see your data. It does not guarantee integrity -- the provider can lie about what it computed. ZKPs close this gap. The provider produces a zero-knowledge proof that the sequence of homomorphic operations it performed on the ciphertext corresponds exactly to the function specification. The proof is verified against the input ciphertext, the output ciphertext, and the function description. If it checks out, you know the computation was honest. If it does not, you know to reject the result and find another provider.

The difficulty is that proving FHE computations in zero knowledge is very expensive. Each homomorphic operation involves polynomial arithmetic over large rings, and the ZKP circuit must encode all of this arithmetic faithfully. Current zkFHE prototypes achieve verification for small circuits -- a few hundred multiplication gates -- and the proving overhead adds another order of magnitude atop FHE's already steep costs. But the research trajectory is clear, and the incentive is enormous: anyone who wants to outsource computation on sensitive data to an untrusted cloud needs both confidentiality (FHE) and integrity (ZKP). Neither alone is sufficient.

**The Privacy Stack.** The key insight about PET composition is architectural: do not think of PETs as individual tools to be selected. Think of them as layers in a protocol stack, analogous to the network stack that separates TCP from IP from Ethernet. At the bottom, differential privacy provides statistical-level guarantees for aggregate data releases -- the coarsest and cheapest form of privacy, suitable for telemetry and census-scale statistics. Above it, MPC provides computation-level privacy for multi-party protocols -- stronger than DP (it protects individual inputs, not just statistical aggregates), but more expensive and limited to specific interaction patterns. Above that, FHE provides data-level privacy for outsourced computation -- stronger still (the computing party learns nothing at all), but with the highest performance cost. And at the top, ZKPs provide verification-level privacy -- the ability to prove properties of private data or private computation without revealing the underlying secrets.

Each layer addresses a different threat. Each has a different cost. And like network layers, they compose vertically: a system might use DP for its public-facing analytics dashboard, MPC for its inter-institutional data sharing, FHE for its cloud-based model training, and ZKPs for its compliance proofs -- all within the same architecture, each operating at its appropriate level of the stack. The system architect who treats PET selection as a single choice ("we will use ZKPs") is making the same mistake as the network engineer who treats protocol selection as a single choice ("we will use TCP"). The answer is almost always a stack, not a single layer.

## Real-World Deployments: Five Case Studies

### 1. Decentriq and the Swiss National Bank

In a federal pilot project beginning in 2021-2022, data clean room technology enabled encrypted collaboration between the Swiss National Bank, SIX (Switzerland's financial market infrastructure provider), and Zurich Cantonal Bank. The goal was cybersecurity threat detection: analyzing patterns of suspicious financial activity across institutions without any institution revealing its transaction data to the others.

The architecture used MPC-style computation within Decentriq's confidential computing platform, combining software-level privacy guarantees with hardware TEEs. The result demonstrated that financial regulators can gain systemic risk visibility without requiring banks to share raw transaction data -- a significant precedent for privacy-preserving financial regulation. The regulator sees the pattern. The banks keep the data. Everyone sleeps better.

### 2. DTCC and the Canton Network

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which processes virtually all US securities transactions, partnered with Digital Asset's Canton Network in December 2025 to tokenize US Treasuries on a permissioned blockchain with privacy-preserving settlement. The architecture uses the Canton protocol's built-in privacy model, where participants see only the portions of the ledger relevant to them.

This deployment matters because of who is adopting. DTCC is not a startup experimenting with privacy. It is the backbone of US securities infrastructure, processing trillions of dollars annually. When DTCC chooses a privacy-preserving architecture, it signals that privacy is not a nice-to-have feature but a regulatory and competitive necessity. The largest financial plumbing system in the world has decided it needs these tools. Pay attention.

### 3. Partisia and Toppan Edge: Digital Student IDs

Toppan Edge and Partisia announced joint development of privacy-preserving digital student IDs in 2025, with a proof-of-concept conducted at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology from June to September 2025. The system combines facial recognition for identity verification, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for credential management, smartphone NFC for physical access, and MPC via Partisia's blockchain for privacy-preserving identity verification.

The key innovation: the student's biometric data is never stored in a single location or revealed to a single party. MPC ensures that identity verification can be performed without any single server holding the student's facial template. The platform is targeted for students enrolling from April 2026. Your face opens the door, but no one holds a copy of your face.

### 4. Privacy Pools: Pragmatic On-Chain Privacy

Privacy Pools, co-authored by Vitalik Buterin and implemented by 0xbow, launched on Ethereum mainnet on April 1, 2025. Buterin was one of the first users, depositing 1 ETH.

The design addresses the fundamental tension between on-chain privacy and regulatory compliance -- a tension that destroyed Tornado Cash and haunts every privacy protocol. Users deposit funds into a pool and can later withdraw them, breaking the link between deposit and withdrawal addresses (similar to Tornado Cash). But Privacy Pools add a compliance layer: an Association Set Provider (ASP) screens deposits for connections to sanctioned or illicit addresses, and the zero-knowledge proof used for withdrawal includes a proof that the user's funds are drawn from a compliant "association set."

The result is "pragmatic privacy" -- transaction privacy for legitimate users, with a built-in compliance mechanism that prevents sanctioned funds from mixing with clean funds. As of early 2026, Privacy Pools has processed over $6 million in volume across more than 1,500 users. The broader ecosystem includes more than 35 teams pursuing approximately 13 distinct approaches to private transfers on Ethereum. The magician proves she is not cheating -- and the regulator is satisfied.

### 5. Apple, Google, and the US Census Bureau: Differential Privacy at Scale

The largest PET deployments in the world are not blockchain systems. They are not even close. They are differential privacy systems serving billions of users:

- **Apple** introduced DP in iOS 10 (2016) for emoji usage statistics, Safari search queries, HealthKit data, and keyboard autocorrect improvements. Each device adds local noise before transmitting data, with $\varepsilon = 2$ per day for most data types.
- **Google** deployed RAPPOR for Chrome settings monitoring, adding randomized responses to usage data before aggregation.
- **US Census Bureau** used the TopDown Algorithm for the 2020 Census, adding calibrated noise to census statistics at every geographic level. The decision was motivated by a concrete threat: the Dinur-Nissim reconstruction theorem proved that releasing too many exact statistics from a dataset eventually allows full reconstruction of individual records.

These deployments demonstrate that differential privacy is the only PET to have achieved planetary-scale adoption. ZKPs, MPC, and FHE remain orders of magnitude smaller in deployment footprint. For the system architect, this suggests that DP should be the first tool considered for statistical data release, with the other PETs reserved for use cases that require computation on raw data or verifiable individual claims. The fog machine is the most popular tool in the privacy toolkit. The magic wand is catching up.

## Privacy Architectures for Smart Contracts: Kachina and Zexe

Two academic systems -- Kachina and Zexe -- represent the theoretical foundations for how private smart contracts can be deployed on blockchains. They take complementary approaches, and understanding both illuminates the design space that every privacy-focused blockchain must work within.

### Kachina: Privacy as a Parameter

Kachina, developed by Kerber, Kiayias, and Kohlweiss at the University of Edinburgh and IOHK, provides a UC-secure (universally composable) framework for privacy-preserving smart contracts. Its key innovation is treating privacy as a *parameter*, not a binary choice. Think of it as a dimmer switch rather than an on/off toggle.

Contract state is split into *shared public* state (on-chain) and *individual private* state (per party, off-chain). Users prove in zero knowledge that their state transitions are valid given some private state and input. The critical architectural insight is the *state oracle transcript*: instead of proving full state transitions (which would require locking shared state), users capture oracle queries and responses as partial transcripts. These transcripts are partial functions over state, enabling concurrent transactions to succeed even when state changes between proof creation and proof submission.

The privacy leakage is formally captured by a *leakage function* Lambda that specifies exactly what information each transaction reveals. Lambda can be tuned from "full leakage" (equivalent to Ethereum, where everything is visible) to "near-zero leakage" (equivalent to Zerocash, where only nullifiers and commitments are visible). This parameterization means the same framework can model both transparent and private contracts, and everything in between. The magician decides, contract by contract, how much of the trick to reveal.

Proving complexity is $O(|T_\rho| + |T_\sigma|)$ -- proportional to the *transcript lengths*, not the full state size. This matters for scalability: a contract with millions of state entries can support private transactions that only touch a few entries, and the proving cost reflects only the entries accessed.

### Zexe: Function Privacy

Zexe, developed by Bowe, Chiesa, Green, Miers, Mishra, and Wu (2018), takes a UTXO-based approach with a stronger privacy guarantee: not only are the transaction data hidden, but the *function being computed* is hidden as well. An observer cannot distinguish a token transfer from a governance vote from a swap -- all transactions look identical on-chain. The audience sees identical envelopes. Every envelope looks the same. The contents are unknowable.

The architecture uses a "records nano-kernel" (RNK) -- a minimalist shared execution environment where records have birth and death predicates. Transactions consume old records and create new ones by satisfying these predicates in zero knowledge. The on-chain footprint is constant: 968 bytes for a 2-input/2-output transaction, regardless of the complexity of the off-chain computation.

Zexe uses recursive proof composition (bounded depth 2, not full recursion) with a BLS-12 curve for inner SNARKs and a Cocks-Pinch curve for outer composition. Proof generation takes roughly one minute plus computation-dependent time. Verification takes tens of milliseconds.

### Comparison

| Property | Kachina | Zexe |
|----------|---------|------|
| State model | Account-based (state machine) | UTXO-based (records) |
| Data privacy | Parameterizable (Lambda function) | Full |
| Function privacy | No (function identity visible) | Yes (all transactions indistinguishable) |
| Concurrency | State oracle transcripts | UTXO model (naturally concurrent) |
| On-chain cost | $O(\text{transcript length})$ | Constant (968 bytes) |
| Proving cost | $O(\text{transcript length})$ | ~1 minute + computation |
| Security model | UC-secure ($\mathcal{F}_\text{nizk}$, $\mathcal{G}_\text{ledger}$ hybrid) | Simulation-based |

Midnight's architecture follows the Kachina model most closely -- parameterizable disclosure via `disclose()`, account-based state, and compiler-enforced privacy boundaries. Aztec's design follows the Zexe model more closely -- UTXO-based notes, client-side proving, and a Private Execution Environment (PXE) that handles proof generation.

For the system architect choosing between these approaches, the key question is: do you need function privacy? If yes (all transactions must be indistinguishable), the Zexe/UTXO model is the natural choice. If no (you can tolerate revealing which function was called, as long as the arguments are private), the Kachina/account model offers simpler programming and easier state management.

## The Regulatory Intersection

Privacy-enhancing technologies do not operate in a regulatory vacuum. For the system architect building in 2026, two regulatory developments demand attention -- and both, in different ways, are pulling the same direction as the technology.

### GDPR and the Blockchain Immutability Paradox

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) adopted Guidelines 02/2025 during its April 2025 plenary, providing the most authoritative guidance to date on GDPR compliance for blockchain systems. The guidelines address a fundamental tension: blockchain's immutability directly conflicts with Article 17 of GDPR -- the right to erasure. If personal data is stored on-chain, it cannot be deleted. The regulation says it must be deletable. Something has to give.

The EDPB's answer is unambiguous: do not store personal data on-chain. The recommended architecture is "off-chain storage and hashing" -- store personally identifiable information (PII) in a mutable off-chain database, and store only a cryptographic hash on-chain. If a data subject exercises their right to erasure, delete the off-chain data and the cryptographic keys linking it to the hash. The on-chain hash becomes an orphaned, meaningless string of characters. The commitment remains. The secret it referenced is gone.

ZKPs play a natural role in this architecture. Instead of storing "Alice is 25 years old and lives in Berlin" on-chain, store a hash of Alice's credential and allow Alice to generate ZK proofs about properties of that credential: "I am over 18" (for age-gated access), "I am a resident of the EU" (for jurisdictional compliance), "I am not on a sanctions list" (for regulatory compliance). The on-chain system never learns Alice's age, address, or identity. It learns only the truth of the specific claims she chooses to prove. The magician reveals exactly what the audience needs to see. No more.

This pattern is called zKYC (zero-knowledge Know Your Customer), and it is rapidly gaining traction. Galactica Network, zyphe, and hyli implement zKYC systems that enable selective disclosure for regulatory compliance. The promise: compliance without surveillance.

The tension between GDPR's right to erasure and blockchain's immutability is worth dwelling on, because it illustrates a deeper architectural principle. The naive response is to declare that blockchains and GDPR are incompatible -- that you cannot have an append-only ledger and a right to delete. But the off-chain-storage-with-on-chain-hash pattern resolves the tension elegantly, and the resolution is instructive. The hash on-chain is not personal data. It is a commitment -- a mathematical fingerprint that proves a piece of data existed at a particular time, without revealing what the data was. Delete the off-chain data, destroy the linking keys, and the hash is cryptographically orphaned. It sits on the blockchain forever, a meaningless 32-byte string, pointing to nothing. The right to erasure is satisfied not by deleting the blockchain entry but by severing the link between the entry and the person it once referenced. The commitment survives. The secret is gone. The regulation is satisfied. This is not a workaround. It is good architecture -- the kind of architecture that PETs make possible.

The zKYC pattern makes this concrete. Consider a bar that needs to verify a customer is over 21. Today, the customer shows a driver's license, and the bartender sees the customer's full name, date of birth, address, driver's license number, organ donor status, and photograph. The bartender needs exactly one bit of information: is this person at least 21? Instead, the customer reveals a dozen pieces of personally identifiable information to a stranger. With zKYC, the customer holds a verifiable credential in a digital wallet -- issued and signed by the government -- and generates a zero-knowledge proof: "the date of birth in my credential, when compared to today's date, yields an age of at least 21." The bartender's verification terminal checks the proof and the government's signature. It learns exactly one fact: the customer is old enough. The name, the address, the license number, the photograph -- none of it crosses the bar. The trick reveals only what the audience needs to see.

### eIDAS 2.0 and the European Digital Identity Wallet

The European Union's eIDAS 2.0 regulation, effective from 2024, mandates that all EU member states offer citizens a European Digital Identity Wallet by 2026. The wallet must support verifiable credentials and selective disclosure -- proving specific attributes (citizenship, age, professional qualifications) without revealing the entire identity document.

ZKPs are a natural technical foundation for selective disclosure in identity wallets. The Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF) for eIDAS 2.0 envisions a credential ecosystem where issuers (governments, universities, professional bodies) issue cryptographically signed credentials, holders store them in their wallets, and verifiers check proofs of specific attributes without seeing the full credential.

The scale of this mandate is easy to understate. By late 2026, every EU member state must provide a digital identity wallet to every citizen who requests one. That is a potential user base of 450 million people. The wallet must interoperate across borders -- a Spanish wallet must be accepted by a German verifier, a French credential must be verifiable in Italy. And the wallet must support selective disclosure by design, not as an afterthought. When a Belgian student presents her wallet to a Portuguese university, the university should be able to verify her degree and her citizenship without learning her tax ID, her medical history, or her home address. The credential is a bundle of attributes. The wallet discloses only the attributes the verifier needs. The rest stays sealed.

This is not a theoretical design. The EU's Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) -- POTENTIAL, EU Digital Identity Wallet Consortium, NOBID, and DC4EU -- have been testing these architectures since 2023, with real users, real credentials, and real cross-border verification. The technical challenge is not the ZKP itself (the cryptography is well understood) but the credential format, the revocation mechanism, the issuer trust framework, and the user interface that makes selective disclosure comprehensible to a non-technical user. The magician's trick is elegant. The stage production -- lighting, sound, audience management -- is where the engineering budget goes.

The regulatory pull is significant: eIDAS 2.0 creates a legal mandate for the privacy properties that ZKPs can provide. For the first time, a major regulatory framework is not just permitting but *requiring* selective disclosure. This transforms ZKPs from a voluntary privacy choice to a compliance necessity for any service that needs to verify European identities. The law now demands the trick.

### Non-Compliance Is Expensive

GDPR violations can result in fines of up to 4% of global annual revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater. For a technology company with $10 billion in revenue, a GDPR violation could cost $400 million. This makes privacy architecture decisions directly material to business risk.

The implication for system architects: the choice of PET is not merely a technical decision. It is a risk management decision with quantifiable financial exposure. An architecture that stores personal data on a public blockchain is not just a privacy risk -- it is a potential nine-figure liability.

## The Decision Matrix

For the system architect who needs to choose a PET (or a combination of PETs), the decision depends on four questions:

**1. What is the trust model?**
- If you need privacy against computationally unbounded adversaries (including future quantum computers): MPC with honest majority provides information-theoretic security.
- If you trust computational hardness assumptions: ZKPs and FHE provide computational security.
- If you trust hardware manufacturers: TEEs provide heuristic security with high performance.

**2. Who has the data?**
- If the data holder needs to prove a property: ZKP (selective disclosure).
- If multiple parties need to compute on their combined data: MPC (collaborative computation).
- If the data needs to be processed by an untrusted third party: FHE (encrypted outsourcing).
- If aggregate statistics need to be released from a dataset: DP (statistical disclosure control).

**3. What performance is acceptable?**
- ZKP proof generation: seconds to minutes. Verification: milliseconds.
- MPC: communication rounds proportional to circuit depth. Latency is the bottleneck.
- FHE: 10,000-1,000,000x overhead over plaintext. Improving rapidly, but still orders of magnitude slower.
- DP: negligible overhead (adding noise to query results is cheap).
- TEE: near-native performance (<5% overhead for many workloads).

**4. What regulatory regime applies?**
- GDPR/eIDAS 2.0: Selective disclosure (ZKP), off-chain storage with on-chain hashing, right-to-erasure compatibility.
- Financial regulation (AML/KYC): zKYC (ZKP for compliance proofs), Privacy Pools (ZKP for provenance), MPC for inter-institutional analysis.
- Healthcare (HIPAA, EU Clinical Trials Regulation): MPC for multi-site computation, DP for statistical releases, FHE for outsourced AI model training.

No single PET answers all four questions. The art is in composition -- and the engineering is in the handoffs between them.

## Open Problems

Three capabilities sit at the frontier of PET research and will likely shape the next generation of privacy architectures:

**Verifiable FHE**: Proving in zero knowledge that an FHE computation was performed correctly. This closes the loop in the healthcare scenario: the AI firm not only computes on encrypted data but also proves that it computed *correctly* on the encrypted data. The surgeon not only operates through the glovebox -- she provides a certificate that the operation was performed to specification. The zkFHE project and SherLOCKED prototype (using RISC Zero's Bonsai zkVM) are early implementations.

**Collaborative/threshold proving**: Distributing ZK proof generation across multiple servers using MPC, so that no single server sees the full witness. The work by Ozdemir and Boneh (USENIX Security 2022) and subsequent improvements in 2024 demonstrate that proof generation itself can be privacy-preserving. This creates a fifth proving model -- between client-side (private but expensive) and delegated (cheap but witness-exposing) -- that combines the privacy of the former with the performance of the latter. The magician's backstage preparation is distributed across multiple locked rooms. No single stagehand sees the whole act.

**Private Information Retrieval (PIR)**: Querying a database without revealing which record you are accessing. A client-side prover in a private rollup (like Aztec) needs to retrieve encrypted notes from the network without revealing which notes belong to them. Recent advances at EUROCRYPT 2026 achieved information-theoretic PIR with sublinear server time and quasilinear space, moving PIR from theoretical curiosity toward practical deployment for billion-entry databases.

## The Incomplete Stack

A thread runs through this chapter that is worth stating plainly.

Privacy is not a feature that you add to a system after it is built. It is a property of the architecture, present from the first design document or absent forever. You cannot retrofit privacy onto a transparent blockchain any more than you can retrofit soundproofing onto a glass house. Or, to stay with our metaphor: you cannot add trapdoors to a stage after the audience is already seated.

The four PETs -- ZKPs, MPC, FHE, and DP -- are not competing technologies. They are complementary tools in a single toolkit. The magician's wand, the glovebox, the fog machine, and the locked vault where multiple parties contribute secrets they never share. Each excels at a different trust problem. Each fails at problems the others solve well. The system architect who understands all four, and who understands how they compose, has a genuine advantage over one who knows only ZKPs and treats every privacy problem as a nail to be hit with the zero-knowledge hammer.

The regulatory environment is, for the first time, pulling in the same direction as the technology. GDPR, eIDAS 2.0, and the global trend toward data sovereignty create legal mandates for exactly the capabilities that PETs provide. The question is no longer "should we use privacy-enhancing technologies?" but "which ones, in what combination, and how do we prove to regulators that they work?"

That last part -- proving to regulators that the privacy technology works -- is, fittingly, itself a zero-knowledge problem. And we have the tools to solve it.

# Part III: Synthesis and the Road Ahead {.unnumbered}

*The trick has been performed seven times, each time revealing a deeper layer of the mechanism. Now we step back from the stage. What does the whole show look like from the back of the theater? Where is the art heading? And does the magic hold up outside the theater, in the harsh light of commerce, regulation, and the passage of time?*
