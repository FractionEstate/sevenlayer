# Arithmetization and Constraint Systems

This document covers Layer 4: how computations become polynomial constraints, how R1CS, AIR, PLONKish, and CCS relate, and why arithmetization dominates modern proof-system design.

## Layer 4 -- Arithmetization

In the previous chapter, we watched the magician go backstage and produce a detailed recording of every step in the computation -- the witness. That recording is private. Now comes the hardest transformation in the entire stack: converting that recording into a form that can be checked mathematically, without re-doing the computation, and without revealing the private data.

Arithmetization: the art of turning a computer program into a system of polynomial equations.

If the previous chapter was about what the magician does backstage, this chapter is about the notation system used to write down what happened. The notation must be precise enough to catch any error, compact enough to be checked quickly, and structured enough to reveal nothing about the performance except its correctness. Finding such a notation -- and making it efficient enough for practical use -- has been the central technical challenge of the zero-knowledge field for the past decade.

*The Sudoku analogy implies a unique solution. Does a ZK proof have one solution or many?*

The answer is: many. There are typically many valid witnesses for a given public statement. If you are proving you know a number whose square is 25, both 5 and -5 work. If you are proving you have a valid passport, any valid passport will do. The Sudoku comparison, popular in introductory ZK writing, misleads precisely because it implies uniqueness -- one grid, one solution, one truth. A zero-knowledge proof is closer to proving you hold *a* winning lottery ticket without showing which one. The distinction matters because the entire machinery of this chapter exists to handle a richer, messier reality than any single-solution puzzle can capture.

Let us be honest at the outset: this is where the magic trick analogy strains hardest. A sealed scorecard, a crossword puzzle, a spreadsheet with rules -- every metaphor we reach for captures one aspect and distorts another. So we will do what Feynman recommended when analogies fail: state what is actually happening in plain language, and trust the reader to follow.

This chapter is longer and more technical than the others. That is because arithmetization is where the conceptual rubber meets the mathematical road. The ideas here -- constraint systems, polynomial identities, lookup arguments, the sumcheck protocol -- are the load-bearing structures of every ZK system in existence. A reader who understands this chapter understands why zero-knowledge proofs work. A reader who skips it must take the rest of the book on faith.

What is actually happening is this. The computation -- every addition, every comparison, every memory access -- gets encoded as relationships between numbers in a finite field. These relationships take the form of polynomial equations. If the computation was performed correctly, all the equations are satisfied simultaneously. If the prover cheated at any step, at least one equation is violated. And here is the key insight that makes the entire field of zero-knowledge proofs possible: checking whether all these polynomial equations hold can be done by evaluating them at a few random points, which is vastly faster than re-executing the original computation.

This chapter tells the story of how the encoding schemes evolved, from the rigid first attempts to the unified framework that powers every modern proof system. It is also, unavoidably, a story about the overhead this encoding imposes -- and whether that overhead is an immutable tax or a temporary engineering constraint.

The story has five acts. First, we establish the spreadsheet metaphor that makes constraint systems intuitive. Second, we trace the evolution from R1CS to AIR to PLONKish, with concrete worked examples showing how each system encodes computation differently. Third, we encounter CCS -- the unifying grammar that reveals all three systems as dialects of the same language -- and the sumcheck protocol that powers verification. Fourth, we follow the lookup revolution from Plookup through Jolt, watching as table lookups replace polynomial constraints as the primary computation paradigm. Fifth, we confront the overhead tax honestly, with concrete numbers showing what the encoding costs in practice and where those costs are falling.

## The Spreadsheet Metaphor (And Where It Works)

Before we encounter the formal constraint systems, we need a mental model. The best available one is the spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet metaphor is not perfect -- we will say where it breaks down -- but it is the most productive starting point. Every major constraint system (R1CS, AIR, PLONKish, CCS) can be understood as a particular way of organizing a spreadsheet and writing rules for its cells. The differences between the systems are differences in how the rules are structured, not in the underlying idea.

Imagine a computation with a thousand steps. You create a giant table. Each row represents one moment in time -- one step of the computation. Each column represents a variable: a processor register, a memory value, a boolean flag. Every cell contains a number drawn from a finite field (think: integers modulo a large prime).

Consider a tiny computation: $x = 3$, $y = 4$, $z = x + y = 7$, then $w = z \times 2 = 14$.

| Row | A (input 1) | B (input 2) | C (result) | Rule |
|-----|-------------|-------------|------------|------|
| 1   | 3           | 4           | 7          | C = A + B |
| 2   | 7           | 2           | 14         | C = A * B |

If every rule holds across every row, the spreadsheet faithfully records the computation. Change any cell, and at least one rule breaks. Suppose a cheating prover changes the result in row 1 from 7 to 9. Row 1 now violates its own rule (3 + 4 is not 9), and row 2 also breaks (because row 2 expects to read 7 from row 1's output, not 9). Errors propagate. This is a two-row example, but the principle scales to millions of rows: one wrong cell poisons the entire spreadsheet.

Now you write rules. "The value in column B at row 5 must equal the value in column A at row 4 plus the value in column C at row 4." "If the opcode column at row 7 says 'multiply,' then column D at row 7 must equal column B at row 7 times column C at row 7." These rules are polynomial equations that relate cells to one another.

Notice that the rules are not arbitrary. They are polynomial equations -- expressions built from addition, subtraction, and multiplication of cell values. This restriction is fundamental. A polynomial rule like "$A \cdot B = C$" is checkable by the proof system. A non-polynomial rule like "if A > B then C = 1 else C = 0" cannot be directly encoded as a polynomial equation because comparison is not a polynomial operation. (It can be encoded *indirectly*, by decomposing A and B into bits and constraining the bit-level comparison, but this adds many auxiliary constraints.) The polynomial restriction is the price of admittance to the proof system. Only relationships expressible as polynomial equations over finite fields can be directly verified. Everything else must be translated into polynomial form first.

If every rule holds across every row, the spreadsheet is *consistent* -- it faithfully records a valid computation. If any rule is violated, the computation was not performed correctly. The prover's job is to fill in the spreadsheet (this is the witness from the previous chapter) and then convince the verifier that all the rules hold. The verifier's job is to check -- but not by examining every cell. Instead, the verifier picks random evaluation points and checks whether the polynomial equations are satisfied there. By the Schwartz-Zippel lemma, a polynomial that is not identically zero will be nonzero at a random point with high probability. The Schwartz-Zippel lemma is the mathematical fact that makes this work: a nonzero polynomial of degree $d$, evaluated at a random point from a field of size $q$, is zero with probability at most $d/q$. For the fields used in ZK (where $q$ is astronomically large), this probability is negligible. One random check is almost as good as checking everywhere. So if the equations check out at the random points, the spreadsheet is almost certainly correct everywhere.

That is the core idea of arithmetization. Every constraint system in this chapter is a different way of organizing the spreadsheet, choosing the rules, and encoding the computation.

> **The Running Example: The Sudoku Constraints**

> Our Sudoku witness becomes a 16-row constraint system. Each cell must satisfy:
>
> - **Range constraint**: $(\text{cell} - 1)(\text{cell} - 2)(\text{cell} - 3)(\text{cell} - 4) = 0$. This polynomial evaluates to zero only when the cell contains a valid value. Four values, one degree-$4$ polynomial per cell.
> - **Given-cell constraint**: For each clue, $\text{cell}_i = \text{given}_i$. Eight equalities for our 8-given puzzle.
> - **Uniqueness constraint**: For each row, column, and 2x2 box, the product $(a - b)$ for all pairs must be nonzero. Equivalently: the polynomial product over all pairs of $(a - b)$ must be nonzero for each group. Eight groups, $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ pairs each, yielding 48 pair checks.
>
> Total: 16 range constraints + 8 given-cell constraints + 48 uniqueness checks = 72 constraints over 16 witness variables. In R1CS form, each degree-$4$ range constraint decomposes into intermediate multiplications, expanding to roughly 120 R1CS constraints. In CCS form, the higher-degree constraints can be expressed directly. The witness (the completed grid) satisfies all 72 constraints. A wrong value in any cell makes at least one polynomial nonzero, and the Schwartz-Zippel lemma catches it with overwhelming probability at a random evaluation point.

Why polynomials? Because of a fact about polynomials: a polynomial of degree $d$ is completely determined by its values at any $d+1$ points. If you know a line (degree $1$), two points fix it exactly. If you know a cubic (degree $3$), four points fix it exactly. This means that if a polynomial "misbehaves" at even a single point, it must be the wrong polynomial -- and checking it at a random point catches this misbehavior with near certainty. A polynomial commitment scheme exploits this: the prover seals a polynomial into a short commitment, and the verifier can spot-check it at random points to confirm it is correct -- without ever seeing the full polynomial.

The metaphor is imperfect in one important respect: a real spreadsheet has rows and columns with human-readable labels. A constraint system is a set of abstract polynomial equations over vectors of field elements. The "rows" and "columns" are a convenient way to think about structure, but the mathematics does not require a rectangular layout. Keep this in mind as we move through the specific systems.

With the spreadsheet image in hand, we can state the central question of this chapter: What is the best way to organize the rules? Should each row have its own custom rule (like R1CS)? Should all rows share the same rule (like AIR)? Should rows have switchable rules controlled by flags (like PLONKish)? Or should all these approaches be unified under a single framework (like CCS)? The history of arithmetization is the history of answering this question, and the answer keeps changing as proof systems evolve and new mathematical tools become available. The constraint systems in the next sections are not mere notation. They are architectural decisions that determine the performance, flexibility, and security of every zero-knowledge proof system built on top of them.

## The Constraint System Evolution: R1CS, AIR, PLONKish

The three major constraint systems -- R1CS, AIR, and PLONKish -- emerged in a span of just seven years (2012-2019). Each was designed to solve a specific limitation of its predecessor, but each also introduced new trade-offs. Understanding this evolution is not optional for understanding modern ZK: every proof system, every zkVM, and every privacy protocol in production today is built on one of these three foundations (or, increasingly, on CCS, which unifies all three).

The history of arithmetization is a history of increasing expressiveness. Each new constraint system solved a specific limitation of its predecessor. Understanding this genealogy is essential because the constraint system you choose determines which proof systems you can use, which fields are efficient, and how much overhead the encoding imposes.

The genealogy also reveals how rapidly the field moves. R1CS was introduced in 2012. By 2023, it was already the "legacy" format -- still deployed in production (Groth16 is not going away), but superseded by more expressive systems for new development. The eleven-year span from R1CS to CCS saw more architectural innovation in constraint system design than the previous four decades of theoretical computer science produced. This acceleration is driven by practical pressure: the economic value of efficient zero-knowledge proofs creates strong incentives for better arithmetization.

### R1CS: The Assembly Language (2012)

The first practical arithmetization emerged from the work of Gennaro, Gentry, Parno, and Raykova (GGPR) in 2012, who introduced the QAP (Quadratic Arithmetic Program) framework that R1CS later formalized. The name "Rank-1 Constraint System" describes the mathematical structure precisely: each constraint has rank 1 (it is the product of two linear functions), and the system is a collection of such constraints. The "rank-1" designation means each constraint captures exactly one multiplication -- a bilinear relationship between variables. Addition is free (it does not require a constraint, because linear combinations can be folded into the matrix entries). Only multiplication generates constraints. This is why the number of R1CS constraints for a circuit equals the number of multiplication gates, not the total number of gates.

Before the mathematical notation, let us ground it in the spreadsheet from the previous section. Imagine your spreadsheet has three special columns -- call them A, B, and C. For each row, column A and column B each contain a combination of the variables, and column C contains the result. The rule for every row is: (what is in column A) multiplied by (what is in column B) must equal (what is in column C). That is all R1CS is: a spreadsheet where every row enforces one multiplication rule. The mathematical notation below says exactly this, just more precisely.

R1CS encodes a computation as a list of constraints, each of the form:

*(linear combination of variables) times (linear combination of variables) equals (linear combination of variables)*

Or, in mathematical notation: $(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{z}) \circ (\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{C} \cdot \mathbf{z}$, where $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathbf{C}$ are sparse matrices and $\mathbf{z}$ is the vector of all variables (public inputs, private witness, and intermediate values). Each row of the matrices defines one constraint. Each constraint captures one multiplication gate.

For the tiny spreadsheet example (3 + 4 = 7, then 7 * 2 = 14), the witness vector is $\mathbf{z} = (1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 14)$ -- the constant 1 followed by the variables x, y, z, w, and the final result. The first row of A selects "x" (entry 1 in position corresponding to x), the first row of B selects "1" (indicating the addition is encoded as (x + y) * 1 = z after reformulation), and the first row of C selects "z". The second row of A selects "z" (value 7), the second row of B selects "w" (value 2), and the second row of C selects "result" (value 14). The matrices are mostly zeros -- only a handful of entries are nonzero. This sparsity is typical: a circuit with millions of constraints has matrices with millions of rows but only a few nonzero entries per row.

R1CS is the assembly language of constraint systems -- simple, well-understood, and directly amenable to proof systems like Groth16 and Spartan. Groth16, deployed across most of the Ethereum ecosystem, works natively with R1CS and produces the smallest possible proofs -- three elliptic curve group elements, constant-time verification.

But R1CS has a fundamental limitation: each constraint is bilinear -- degree $2$. You can encode a multiplication ($a \cdot b = c$) directly. But what about a computation that requires checking a hash function, where a single invocation might need thousands of multiplications? You encode each multiplication as a separate constraint, one after another. There is no way to express a higher-degree relationship in a single constraint, and there is no notion of "this constraint applies uniformly across all time steps." Every gate gets its own row.

For small circuits, R1CS works beautifully. For large, repetitive computations -- like executing millions of processor instructions in a zkVM -- the lack of structure becomes a liability.

To see this concretely, consider encoding a computation with 10 million multiplication gates in R1CS. You need 10 million rows in the matrices A, B, and C. Each matrix is sparse (most entries are zero), but the total number of nonzero entries -- and hence the prover's work -- scales linearly with the gate count. There is no compression possible: R1CS treats each gate independently, with no awareness that gate 5,000,001 might be performing exactly the same operation as gate 1. Compare this to a function that repeats the same 1,000-gate circuit 10,000 times: R1CS still requires 10,000,000 separate constraints, while a structured constraint system could potentially describe the repeating pattern once and instantiate it 10,000 times. This structural blindness is what motivated the search for richer constraint formats.

Yet R1CS persists. Groth16 proofs (which require R1CS) remain the gold standard for on-chain verification because of their unmatched proof size: 3 group elements, roughly 128 bytes, verifiable in constant time. No other proof system achieves this compactness. When Ethereum smart contracts verify ZK proofs, the gas cost of verification is proportional to proof size -- and Groth16's tiny proofs mean minimal gas costs. Many production systems (Zcash, Tornado Cash, Worldcoin) use Groth16 for precisely this reason, accepting the constraint system's limitations in exchange for the proof system's efficiency. R1CS is the assembly language: nobody wants to write it directly, but the machine code it produces is unbeatable.

### AIR: The State Machine (2018)

The Algebraic Intermediate Representation arrived alongside STARKs, introduced by Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, and Riabzev in 2018. The name is precise: "Algebraic" because the constraints are polynomial equations over fields (not boolean circuits or SAT formulas). "Intermediate" because AIR sits between the high-level computation and the low-level proof system -- it is the "compiled" form of the computation, analogous to LLVM IR in a compiler toolchain. "Representation" because it is a way of representing the computation, not the computation itself. AIR solves the structure problem by embracing the spreadsheet metaphor directly.

An AIR consists of two things: an execution trace (a 2D matrix where rows are time steps and columns are algebraic registers) and transition constraints (polynomial equations that must hold between consecutive rows). The constraints are *uniform* -- the same polynomial equations apply at every row.

This uniformity is AIR's great strength and its great limitation. It is a perfect fit for sequential computations where the same operation repeats: hash chains, state machine execution, virtual machine instruction cycles. The constraint "if the opcode is ADD, then the output register equals the sum of the two input registers" applies identically at every step. You write it once; it is enforced everywhere.

The word "uniform" deserves emphasis. In R1CS, each constraint row can encode a completely different relationship between variables. Row 1 might enforce $a + b = c$; row 2 might enforce $d \cdot e = f$; row 3 might enforce $g = h$. Each row is independent. In AIR, every row obeys the same set of transition polynomials. If the transition constraint says "$\text{column\_3}[\text{next}] = \text{column\_1}[\text{current}] + \text{column\_2}[\text{current}]$," then this relationship holds at every pair of consecutive rows. The prover cannot make exceptions. This rigidity is what enables compression: a single polynomial equation describes the entire computation, regardless of how many steps it contains.

The limitation is that AIR cannot natively handle non-uniform computation. If your program has different instruction types -- additions, multiplications, hash invocations, memory accesses -- you need tricks to encode the selection logic ("which instruction is executing at this row?") within the uniform framework. This is possible but adds complexity and overhead.

In practice, real STARK-based systems handle non-uniformity by using multiple AIR traces -- one per "sub-machine." Cairo's architecture, for example, decomposes the VM into separate traces for the CPU, memory, range checks, and each built-in operation (Pedersen hash, ECDSA, bitwise operations). Each trace is a separate AIR with its own transition constraints. Cross-trace consistency is enforced through permutation arguments and lookup arguments that connect the traces: when the CPU trace records "hash instruction at step 1000," the hash trace must contain a corresponding row with matching inputs and outputs. This multi-trace design preserves AIR's uniformity within each trace while handling the non-uniformity of a full instruction set across traces. The cost is the cross-trace connection overhead, but for computations dominated by a single operation type (as hash-heavy applications often are), the overhead is manageable.

AIR became the foundation of the STARK ecosystem: StarkWare's Stone and Stwo provers, Polygon Miden, and others. Its tight coupling with FRI (the hash-based polynomial commitment scheme) means AIR-based systems are transparent (no trusted setup) and plausibly post-quantum secure.

The AIR-FRI coupling deserves a moment of attention because it illustrates how Layers 4 and 5 (arithmetization and proof system) become inseparable. FRI works by repeatedly folding a polynomial in half -- reducing its degree by a factor of 2 at each step -- and checking consistency at random points. This folding requires the polynomial to be evaluated on a domain with a specific multiplicative structure (a "coset" of a subgroup of the field). AIR traces are naturally expressed as polynomials on such domains because the trace rows correspond to consecutive powers of a group generator. The uniformity of AIR's transition constraints means the constraint polynomial has the same degree structure as the trace polynomial, which is exactly what FRI needs. Try to use FRI with a non-uniform constraint system (like PLONKish), and you need additional machinery (permutation polynomials, selector commitments) that adds overhead. AIR and FRI were born for each other.

#### A Tiny AIR: The Counter

To make AIR concrete, consider the simplest possible state machine: a counter that starts at 0 and increments by 1 each step. The execution trace has two columns -- `counter` (the current value) and `flag` (whether to increment) -- and three rows:

| Row | counter | flag |
|-----|---------|------|
| 0   | 0       | 1    |
| 1   | 1       | 1    |
| 2   | 2       | 1    |

The transition constraint is a single polynomial equation that must hold between every pair of consecutive rows:

$\text{counter}[i+1] = \text{counter}[i] + \text{flag}[i]$

Check it. Between rows 0 and 1: does 1 = 0 + 1? Yes. Between rows 1 and 2: does 2 = 1 + 1? Yes. The trace is valid.

Now suppose a cheating prover submits a trace where row 2 claims `counter = 5`. The transition constraint between rows 1 and 2 becomes: does 5 = 1 + 1? No. The constraint is violated, and the proof fails.

There is a subtlety that the transition constraint alone does not capture: the starting value. The transition constraint says "each row follows correctly from the previous row," but it says nothing about where the counter begins. A trace starting at counter = 1000 with flag = 1 at every row would satisfy the transition constraint perfectly -- 1000, 1001, 1002 -- even though the counter was supposed to start at 0. This is where **boundary constraints** enter. A boundary constraint pins a specific cell to a specific value: "counter at row 0 must equal 0." In an AIR, you typically have transition constraints (which apply uniformly between consecutive rows) and boundary constraints (which apply at specific rows, usually the first and last). The transition constraints ensure the computation proceeds correctly; the boundary constraints ensure it starts and ends in the right place.

The full AIR for this counter is therefore:

- Transition constraint: $\text{counter}[i+1] = \text{counter}[i] + \text{flag}[i]$ (for all consecutive row pairs)
- Boundary constraint: $\text{counter}[0] = 0$ (the counter starts at zero)
- Boundary constraint: $\text{flag}[i] \cdot (1 - \text{flag}[i]) = 0$ (each flag is boolean -- either 0 or 1)

The boolean constraint on the flag deserves attention. Without it, a cheating prover could set flag = 7 at some row, making the counter jump by 7 instead of 0 or 1. The constraint $\text{flag} \cdot (1 - \text{flag}) = 0$ is satisfied only when flag is 0 or 1 (plug in either value and one factor is zero). This is a polynomial constraint of degree $2$ -- exactly the kind of equation that AIR handles naturally.

The critical observation is what the prover *wrote down* to define this constraint system. Not three separate rules -- one for each row -- but a small set of polynomial equations applied uniformly across the entire trace. One transition rule and a few boundary conditions, enforced everywhere. If the counter had a million rows instead of three, the constraint description would be identical: the same equations. Only the trace grows; the constraints stay fixed.

This is the structural difference from R1CS. In R1CS, you would write a separate constraint for each row: "row 0's output equals row 0's input plus row 0's flag," then "row 1's output equals row 1's input plus row 1's flag," and so on -- one constraint per step. For a million-step computation, you need a million constraints. In AIR, you write the rule once. The prover fills in the trace; the polynomial machinery checks the rule everywhere simultaneously.

For repetitive computations -- hash chains where the same compression function executes thousands of times, virtual machines where the same instruction cycle repeats for every step -- AIR's uniformity is not just convenient. It is a compression of the constraint description itself, from linear in the number of steps to constant in the number of distinct transition rules. That compression is what made STARKs practical for proving large computations.

One further detail illuminates how the polynomial machinery works behind the scenes. The prover does not submit the raw trace table to the verifier. Instead, the prover interpolates each column of the trace as a polynomial. For the counter column with values (0, 1, 2), the prover finds a polynomial $P(x)$ such that $P(0) = 0$, $P(1) = 1$, $P(2) = 2$ -- in this case, simply $P(x) = x$. For the flag column with values (1, 1, 1), the polynomial is $F(x) = 1$. The transition constraint "$P(x+1) = P(x) + F(x)$" becomes a polynomial identity that must hold at $x = 0$ and $x = 1$ (every pair of consecutive rows). The proof system checks this identity at a random evaluation point -- not at $x = 0$ or $x = 1$, but at some random $r$ chosen by the verifier -- and the Schwartz-Zippel lemma guarantees that a false identity will fail this random check with overwhelming probability.

The trace, the constraints, and the verification all reduce to polynomials. The trace columns are polynomials. The transition constraint is a polynomial identity. The verification is a polynomial evaluation. This is what "arithmetization" means in practice: every aspect of the computation becomes a polynomial, and every check becomes a polynomial evaluation.

The polynomial encoding also reveals the source of the overhead. The counter trace has 3 rows and 2 columns -- 6 values. But the polynomials that interpolate these columns have degree $2$ (you need a degree-$2$ polynomial to pass through 3 points in general). The transition constraint, when expressed as a polynomial, produces a "constraint polynomial" whose degree is the sum of the degrees of the trace polynomials it involves. If the trace polynomial has degree $d$ and the transition constraint has algebraic degree $k$, the constraint polynomial has degree roughly $d \cdot k$. For a trace with $n$ rows, $d$ is roughly $n$, so the constraint polynomial has degree roughly $n \cdot k$. This polynomial must be shown to vanish on all consecutive-row pairs, which means it is divisible by a "vanishing polynomial" $Z(x)$ that has roots at the evaluation domain. The quotient $T(x) = \text{constraint}(x) / Z(x)$ is the polynomial the prover commits to; if the division is exact (no remainder), the constraints are satisfied. If the prover cheated, the division leaves a remainder, and the random evaluation check catches it.

This is where the NTTs come in. Converting between coefficient and evaluation representations of these high-degree polynomials requires the Number Theoretic Transform -- the finite-field version of the FFT -- which dominates the prover's computation time.

The limitation is equally visible. Suppose you want some rows to add and other rows to multiply. With a single uniform constraint, you cannot express "do addition at row 5 and multiplication at row 6" without encoding the selection logic into the polynomial itself -- adding flag columns, conditional terms, and degree overhead. The counter example is clean because every row does the same thing. Real programs do not.

### PLONKish: The Custom Workshop (2019)

PLONK, introduced by Gabizon, Williamson, and Ciobotaru in 2019, took a different approach. Instead of uniform constraints, PLONKish arithmetization uses *selector columns* to enable non-uniform gates.

The key innovation separates the constraint system into two components:

1. **Gate constraints**: polynomial equations controlled by selector polynomials. Different rows can have different gate types. If the selector for "addition" is active at row 5, the addition constraint is enforced there. If the selector for "multiplication" is active at row 6, the multiplication constraint is enforced there. You can define custom gates for any operation you need.

2. **Copy constraints**: a permutation argument that enforces wiring -- ensuring that the output of one gate is correctly fed as input to another gate. This replaces R1CS's matrix-based variable assignment with a more flexible connection mechanism.

PLONKish sits between R1CS and AIR in expressiveness. Like AIR, it uses a structured trace with rows and columns. Unlike AIR, different rows can follow different rules. Like R1CS, it can handle arbitrary circuits. Unlike R1CS, it supports custom gates that capture complex operations in fewer constraints.

PLONKish became the dominant arithmetization in deployed systems. Halo2 (used by Zcash and Scroll), Polygon zkEVM (before its shutdown), and numerous other production systems chose PLONKish because its flexibility handles the diverse instruction sets of real-world computations. The Halo2 library, originally developed by the Electric Coin Company for the Zcash Orchard protocol, became the de facto standard for PLONKish circuit development. Its "region-based" API lets developers define gates, assign cells, and specify copy constraints in a structured way that catches many common errors at compile time. Scroll's zkEVM -- one of the most ambitious ZK projects ever attempted -- encoded the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine instruction set as Halo2 PLONKish circuits, using custom gates for EVM opcodes, lookup arguments for bytecode verification, and copy constraints to wire the data path. The resulting circuit has millions of constraints per block and requires GPU clusters to prove, but it works -- which says something about PLONKish's flexibility.

#### A Tiny PLONKish Circuit: Compute 3 + 4, Then Multiply, Then Add Again

Here is a three-row PLONKish trace that computes (3 + 4) * 2 + 1 = 15. The trace has three "witness" columns (a, b, c) and two "selector" columns (q_add, q_mul):

| Row | a  | b  | c  | q_add | q_mul |
|-----|----|----|----|-------|-------|
| 0   | 3  | 4  | 7  | 1     | 0     |
| 1   | 7  | 2  | 14 | 0     | 1     |
| 2   | 14 | 1  | 15 | 1     | 0     |

The gate constraint is a single equation evaluated at every row:

$q_{\text{add}} \cdot (a + b - c) + q_{\text{mul}} \cdot (a \cdot b - c) = 0$

At row 0: $q_{\text{add}} = 1$, $q_{\text{mul}} = 0$, so the equation becomes $1 \cdot (3 + 4 - 7) + 0 \cdot (\ldots) = 0$. Check: $0 = 0$. The addition gate is active.

At row 1: $q_{\text{add}} = 0$, $q_{\text{mul}} = 1$, so the equation becomes $0 \cdot (\ldots) + 1 \cdot (7 \cdot 2 - 14) = 0$. Check: $0 = 0$. The multiplication gate is active.

At row 2: $q_{\text{add}} = 1$, $q_{\text{mul}} = 0$, so the equation becomes $1 \cdot (14 + 1 - 15) + 0 \cdot (\ldots) = 0$. Check: $0 = 0$. The addition gate is active again.

The selectors act as switches. When $q_{\text{add}} = 1$ and $q_{\text{mul}} = 0$, only the addition constraint is "on." When the selectors flip, only the multiplication constraint is "on." One polynomial equation, evaluated identically at every row, enforces different gate types depending on which selector is active.

But the gate constraint alone does not guarantee correctness. Look at the trace: row 0 produces c = 7, and row 1 consumes a = 7. How does the proof system know these two 7s are the *same* value -- that the output of row 0 actually flows into the input of row 1?

This is the job of the **copy constraint**. A permutation argument -- a separate cryptographic mechanism outside the gate equation -- enforces that the cell (row 0, column c) contains the same value as the cell (row 1, column a). Similarly, (row 1, column c) must equal (row 2, column a). The permutation argument works by proving that a certain set of values is a rearrangement of another set, which can only be true if the "wired" cells agree. Without copy constraints, a cheating prover could fill row 1 with a = 999 and the gate equation would still pass (as long as 999 * 2 = c at row 1). The copy constraint is what stitches the circuit together.

To see the copy constraint at work, consider what happens without it. A cheating prover submits this trace:

| Row | a  | b  | c  | q_add | q_mul |
|-----|----|----|----|-------|-------|
| 0   | 3  | 4  | 7  | 1     | 0     |
| 1   | 99 | 2  | 198| 0     | 1     |
| 2   | 198| 1  | 199| 1     | 0     |

Every gate constraint passes: 3 + 4 = 7, 99 * 2 = 198, 198 + 1 = 199. But the computation is wrong -- row 1 should have used a = 7 (the output of row 0), not a = 99. Without the copy constraint binding cell (row 0, c) to cell (row 1, a), the prover is free to insert any value it likes. The copy constraint catches this: it requires that position (row 0, column c) and position (row 1, column a) hold the same value. Since 7 is not 99, the permutation check fails, and the proof is rejected.

This reveals why PLONKish is more flexible than AIR. In the AIR counter example, every row obeyed the same transition rule. Here, row 0 adds, row 1 multiplies, and row 2 adds again -- three different operations in three rows, controlled by selector values. You can define custom gates for any operation: a "range check" gate, a "Poseidon hash round" gate, an "elliptic curve addition" gate. Each gets its own selector column, and the prover activates whichever gate the computation requires at each row. The trace is a heterogeneous computation log, not a uniform state machine.

The power of custom gates becomes clearer with a slightly more complex example. Suppose you want to enforce that a value lies in the range $[0, 255]$ -- an 8-bit range check. In R1CS, you would decompose the value into 8 bits, constrain each bit to be boolean (8 constraints), and constrain the sum to equal the original value (1 constraint) -- 9 constraints total. In PLONKish, you can define a single custom "range gate" that encodes the entire check in one row, using a lookup argument or a specialized polynomial identity. One row, one gate, one constraint. The circuit designer creates the gate once; the prover activates it wherever a range check is needed.

The cost of this flexibility is the copy constraint machinery. The permutation argument adds overhead -- both in proof size and in prover computation -- that AIR avoids because AIR's uniform structure implicitly handles data flow between consecutive rows. But for computations that mix many different operations (as real programs do), the overhead is worth paying.

#### The Same Computation, Three Encodings

To crystallize the differences, consider encoding the same simple computation -- "compute $x \cdot (x + 1)$ where $x = 3$, so the result is $12$" -- in all three systems.

**In R1CS:** You need two constraints. First, an addition: an intermediate variable $t = x + 1 = 4$. Then a multiplication: $\text{result} = x \cdot t = 3 \cdot 4 = 12$. Each constraint takes one row in the R1CS matrix. The matrices A, B, C encode the variable wiring. Two rows, two constraints, done.

**In AIR:** You set up a two-row trace. Row 0 holds $x = 3$ and computes $t = x + 1 = 4$. Row 1 holds the multiplication $\text{result} = x \cdot t = 12$. The transition constraint relates consecutive rows. But here is the awkwardness: the addition and the multiplication are *different* operations, and AIR wants uniform constraints across all rows. You either need to encode both operations into a single transition polynomial (using conditional logic with flag columns, which increases the constraint degree), or you define a two-step cycle where even rows add and odd rows multiply (which works but means half the trace structure is "wasted" on selection logic). For this tiny example, AIR is overkill.

**In PLONKish:** Row 0 uses the addition gate: $a = 3$, $b = 1$, $c = 4$ ($q_{\text{add}} = 1$). Row 1 uses the multiplication gate: $a = 3$, $b = 4$, $c = 12$ ($q_{\text{mul}} = 1$). A copy constraint links (row 0, column c) to (row 1, column b), and another links the input $x = 3$ to (row 1, column a). Two rows, two different gate types, clean and direct.

The comparison reveals each system's natural habitat. R1CS handles this computation most directly -- two bilinear constraints, no overhead. PLONKish handles it almost as directly, with slight overhead from the copy constraints. AIR handles it least naturally, because the computation is not repetitive -- there is no pattern that repeats across many rows. For a computation that *is* repetitive (running the same hash compression 1000 times), the ranking reverses: AIR wins by writing the constraint once, while R1CS and PLONKish must either repeat the constraint description 1000 times or use recursion to simulate repetition.

The constraint count for the same computation across different systems is instructive:

| System | Constraints for x*(x+1) | Constraints for 1000 hash rounds | Why |
|--------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-----|
| R1CS | 2 | ~30,000,000 | 1 constraint per gate, ~30,000 per hash round |
| AIR | ~4 (with padding) | ~30,000 | One transition polynomial, reused 1000 times |
| PLONKish | 2 (+ copy constraints) | ~15,000,000 | Custom hash gates cut per-round cost in half |

The numbers are approximate, but the ratios are revealing. For the tiny computation, all three systems are roughly comparable. For the hash chain, AIR's constraint count is independent of the number of repetitions -- it depends only on the number of distinct transition types. This is why STARKs dominate in hash-heavy workloads (blockchain state verification, recursive proof composition) while PLONKish dominates in mixed workloads (smart contract execution, general-purpose circuits).

A clarification for the precise reader: AIR's "~30,000" for 1000 hash rounds refers to the *constraint description* size -- the number of distinct polynomial equations that must hold. The actual *trace* still has 1000 * (rows per hash round) rows, each of which must satisfy the constraints. The prover's work is proportional to the trace size, not the constraint description size. But the constraint description size matters for the verifier (who must check the polynomial identity, not every row) and for the proof size (which depends on the degree of the constraint polynomial, not the number of trace rows). The asymmetry between "small constraint description, large trace" is precisely what makes AIR efficient for repetitive computations: the verifier's work grows with the constraint complexity, not with the number of repetitions.

### Three Dialects, One Problem

By 2022, the ZK ecosystem had three constraint system families, each with its own proof systems, tooling, and community:

| System | Year | Constraint Structure | Best For | Key Proof Systems |
|--------|------|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| R1CS | 2012 | Bilinear (degree 2) | Small circuits, Groth16 | Groth16, Spartan, Nova |
| AIR | 2018 | Uniform polynomial | VM traces, STARKs | STARKs (Stone, Stwo) |
| PLONKish | 2019 | Selector-gated, custom | Flexible circuits | PLONK, Halo2 |

A folding scheme designed for R1CS could not accept AIR input. A proof system built for AIR could not handle PLONKish circuits. A developer choosing an arithmetization was simultaneously choosing a proof system ecosystem -- and switching later meant rewriting everything.

The fragmentation had real costs. When the Polygon team decided to migrate from Hermez (PLONK-based) to a STARK-based architecture, the circuit rewrite took years. When Scroll built their zkEVM on Halo2 (PLONKish), they could not easily adopt the newer sumcheck-based proof systems that emerged in 2023-2024 without rewriting their entire constraint system. Research teams working on folding schemes had to choose: target R1CS (like Nova did) and exclude the STARK ecosystem, or target a custom format and exclude everyone else. The constraint system choice was a one-way door -- enter through it, and you are locked into the corresponding proof system family for the life of the project.

The field needed a unifier. Not a compromise format that sacrificed efficiency for generality, but a mathematical framework that could express R1CS, AIR, and PLONKish as special cases -- preserving the efficiency of each while providing a single target for proof systems to implement.

## CCS: The Rosetta Stone

In 2023, Srinath Setty, Justin Thaler, and Riad Wahby published a paper that changed constraint system design. Customizable Constraint Systems (CCS) unified R1CS, AIR, and PLONKish into a single mathematical framework, without overhead.

The word "without overhead" is the point. Previous attempts at unification existed -- for example, you can always convert AIR to R1CS by expanding every transition into individual constraints, or convert R1CS to AIR by padding with identity transitions. But these conversions incur blowup: the converted instance is larger, sometimes much larger, than the original. CCS achieves something different: it captures each constraint format in its native form, preserving the sparsity and structure that makes each format efficient. An R1CS instance becomes a CCS instance of exactly the same size. An AIR instance becomes a CCS instance of exactly the same size. Nothing is wasted in translation.

### The Idea

A CCS instance is defined by a set of sparse matrices $M_1, \ldots, M_t$ over a finite field, a collection of multisets $S_1, \ldots, S_q$ (each specifying which matrices to multiply together element-wise), and constants $c_1, \ldots, c_q$. The satisfying condition is:

$\sum_{i=1}^{q} c_i \cdot \bigcirc_{j \in S_i} (M_j \cdot \mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{0}$

(The Hadamard product is simply element-wise multiplication: $[a, b, c] \circ [d, e, f] = [ad, be, cf]$. When the formula says "Hadamard product of $M_j \cdot \mathbf{z}$," it means: compute each matrix-vector product separately, then multiply the resulting vectors element by element.)

This looks abstract. Here is what it means concretely.

**R1CS is CCS with two terms.** Set $q = 2$, $S_1 = \{1, 2\}$, $S_2 = \{3\}$, $c_1 = 1$, $c_2 = -1$. The satisfying condition becomes $(M_1 \cdot \mathbf{z}) \circ (M_2 \cdot \mathbf{z}) - (M_3 \cdot \mathbf{z}) = 0$, which is exactly the R1CS equation $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{z} \circ \mathbf{B}\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{z}$ when you identify $M_1 = A$, $M_2 = B$, $M_3 = C$.

**AIR is CCS with matrices encoding shift relations.** The transition constraints between consecutive rows become matrix-vector products with appropriate shift structure.

**PLONKish is CCS with matrices encoding selector-weighted gate equations.** The selector polynomials become entries in the matrices; the copy constraints map to specific matrix structures.

The key insight is not that CCS enables new computations -- any NP statement can already be expressed in R1CS. The insight is that CCS provides a *uniform interface*. A proof system that targets CCS automatically handles R1CS, AIR, and PLONKish inputs without conversion overhead. Write one folding scheme for CCS, and it works with every constraint format the industry has produced.

### Why CCS Matters Now

CCS is the native constraint system for every major modern folding scheme:

- **HyperNova** (Kothapalli and Setty, 2023): multi-folding for CCS, using the sumcheck protocol to fold multiple CCS instances simultaneously.
- **ProtoStar** and **ProtoGalaxy** (2023): folding schemes that generalize Nova to higher-degree constraint systems -- which CCS naturally supports.
- **Neo** (Nguyen and Setty, 2025): the first lattice-based folding scheme for CCS, achieving post-quantum security with native small-field efficiency.
- **LatticeFold+** (Boneh and Chen, 2025): extends LatticeFold with faster, simpler lattice-based folding and shorter proofs.

Without CCS, none of these systems could claim generality. Each would be locked to R1CS (like Nova) or would need separate implementations for each constraint format. CCS is the abstraction layer that made the folding revolution possible.

The gap between research and deployment is real, however. Production systems in early 2026 still largely use PLONKish (Halo2, Scroll) or AIR (StarkWare, Stwo). The CCS-native stack is approximately two to three years behind the research frontier. But the trajectory is clear: as folding-based proof systems move from research prototypes to production deployments, CCS will become the standard target.

The parallel to programming language history is instructive. In the 1960s, each computer had its own instruction set, its own assembler, and its own operating conventions. Writing a program for an IBM 7090 required completely different code than writing for a UNIVAC 1108. Then came C and UNIX, which provided a common language and a common operating system interface. Programs written in C could run on any machine with a C compiler. CCS plays the same role for constraint systems: it provides a common mathematical interface that any proof system can target. Write your constraints in CCS, and any CCS-compatible proof system -- HyperNova, ProtoStar, Neo -- can prove them. The "operating system" for zero-knowledge proof systems is being standardized, even if the "applications" (production deployments) have not yet caught up.

### The Degree Parameter

One subtle but important feature of CCS is the degree parameter $d$, which captures the maximum degree of the constraint polynomials. R1CS has $d = 2$ (bilinear constraints). PLONKish can have $d = 2$ or higher, depending on the custom gate design. CCS handles arbitrary degree without modification.

This matters because higher-degree constraints can capture more complex operations in fewer constraints. A single degree-$4$ constraint can express relationships that would require multiple degree-$2$ R1CS constraints. The tradeoff is that higher-degree constraints require more sophisticated proof techniques -- but the sumcheck protocol, which we turn to next, handles arbitrary degrees naturally.

To see the degree parameter in action, return to the "x * (x + 1)" computation. In R1CS ($d = 2$), this requires two constraints: $t = x + 1$ (degree $1$, but padded to the bilinear form as $(x + 1) \cdot 1 = t$) and $\text{result} = x \cdot t$ (degree $2$). In a CCS instance with $d = 3$, you could express the entire computation in a single constraint: $x \cdot (x + 1) - \text{result} = 0$, which is a degree-$2$ polynomial in $x$. With $d = 4$, you could encode $x \cdot (x + 1) \cdot (x + 2) - \text{result} = 0$ in a single constraint -- a relationship that would require three R1CS constraints (one for each pairwise multiplication). Higher degree means more computation packed into fewer constraints, at the cost of more complex proof machinery.

### Three Dialects, One Grammar

Return to the three micro-examples we built in the previous sections and look at them through the CCS lens. What CCS reveals is that R1CS, AIR, and PLONKish are not three different formalisms. They are three dialects of the same language.

**R1CS is CCS with $q = 2$.** You need exactly two multisets: $S_1 = \{1, 2\}$ (which multiplies the results of matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ element-wise) and $S_2 = \{3\}$ (which provides $M_3$'s result). The CCS equation becomes $c_1 \cdot (M_1 \cdot \mathbf{z} \circ M_2 \cdot \mathbf{z}) + c_2 \cdot (M_3 \cdot \mathbf{z}) = 0$, with $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = -1$. This is exactly $(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{z}) \circ (\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{z}) - \mathbf{C} \cdot \mathbf{z} = 0$ -- the R1CS equation, expressed in CCS notation. Two matrix-vector products, one Hadamard product, one subtraction. That is the entire constraint system. Every R1CS instance that has ever been deployed -- every Groth16 proof, every Spartan verification -- is a CCS instance with $q = 2$.

For the "3 * 4 = 12" multiplication from the spreadsheet example, the CCS encoding has $t = 3$ matrices ($M_1 = A$, $M_2 = B$, $M_3 = C$), $q = 2$ multisets ($S_1 = \{1, 2\}$ and $S_2 = \{3\}$), and the witness vector $\mathbf{z} = (1, 3, 4, 12)$ where the first entry is the constant 1. The matrix A selects the left operand (3), B selects the right operand (4), and C selects the output (12). The Hadamard product $(\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{z}) \circ (\mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{z})$ computes $3 \cdot 4 = 12$ element-wise, and subtracting $\mathbf{C} \cdot \mathbf{z} = 12$ yields zero. One constraint, three matrices, one Hadamard product.

**AIR is CCS with shift matrices.** The counter example from earlier had the transition constraint $\text{counter}[i+1] = \text{counter}[i] + \text{flag}[i]$. In CCS, this becomes a set of matrices where one matrix $M_{\text{shift}}$ extracts the "next row" values and another $M_{\text{current}}$ extracts the "current row" values. For a 3-row trace, $M_{\text{current}}$ might have ones on the diagonal (selecting counter[0], counter[1], counter[2]) while $M_{\text{shift}}$ has ones on the superdiagonal (selecting counter[1], counter[2], counter[0] with wraparound). The shift operation -- looking at row i + 1 instead of row i -- is encoded in the matrix structure itself. The polynomial constraint between consecutive rows becomes a matrix-vector product where the matrix has ones on a shifted diagonal. What looked like a fundamentally different formalism (rules between consecutive rows, rather than rules within a single row) turns out to be a specific matrix pattern within CCS.

**PLONKish is CCS with selector-weighted matrices.** The PLONKish trace with its $q_{\text{add}}$ and $q_{\text{mul}}$ columns maps to CCS matrices where the selector values are baked into the matrix entries. The gate equation $q_{\text{add}} \cdot (a + b - c) + q_{\text{mul}} \cdot (a \cdot b - c) = 0$ becomes a CCS instance where one multiset captures the addition term (weighted by $q_{\text{add}}$) and another captures the multiplication term (weighted by $q_{\text{mul}}$). The copy constraints -- the permutation argument that wires outputs to inputs -- map to additional matrix structure that enforces equality between specific positions in the witness vector.

The visual is this: imagine three spreadsheets, each with different column headers and different rules. The R1CS spreadsheet has columns A, B, C with the rule "A times B equals C." The AIR spreadsheet has columns for registers with the rule "next row relates to current row by this transition polynomial." The PLONKish spreadsheet has witness columns and selector columns with the rule "the active gate constraint must be satisfied." Three different layouts. Three different conventions. But CCS says: they are all just matrices times a witness vector, combined with Hadamard products and summed to zero. One grammar, three dialects.

This is not a metaphor. It is a theorem. Any R1CS instance, any AIR instance, any PLONKish instance can be mechanically translated into a CCS instance with no increase in constraint count or witness size. The translation preserves everything -- the structure, the sparsity, the degree. When a proof system like HyperNova targets CCS, it is not accepting a lowest-common-denominator format. It is accepting the universal format that contains every existing constraint dialect as a special case.

The practical consequence is immediate. Before CCS, a developer choosing R1CS was simultaneously choosing Groth16 or Spartan. A developer choosing AIR was choosing STARKs. A developer choosing PLONKish was choosing Halo2 or PLONK. Switching constraint systems meant rewriting the circuit and the proof system integration. CCS breaks this coupling. Write your constraints in whichever dialect is natural for your computation -- R1CS for simple circuits, AIR for VM traces, PLONKish for mixed-gate workloads -- and any CCS-compatible proof system will accept them without translation overhead. The grammar is universal; the dialects are a matter of convenience.

There is a deeper mathematical point here, one that Penrose would appreciate. The existence of a universal constraint grammar is not obvious. One might have expected that the structural differences between R1CS (bilinear, flat), AIR (uniform, sequential), and PLONKish (selector-gated, permutation-wired) would require genuinely different proof techniques -- that no single algebraic framework could capture all three without paying some conversion tax. CCS demonstrates that the differences are shallow. At the level of sparse matrix-vector products and Hadamard products, all three constraint systems are doing the same thing. The "three families" narrative that dominated ZK from 2018 to 2022 was a historical artifact, not a mathematical necessity.

CCS provides the universal grammar. Sumcheck provides the universal verification engine. The two are partners: CCS tells us *what* the constraints look like -- a sum of Hadamard products of matrix-vector pairs -- and sumcheck tells us *how to check* that sum without evaluating every term. The verifier does not inspect every cell of the constraint spreadsheet. Instead, sumcheck reduces the problem: "does this multilinear polynomial sum to zero over the boolean hypercube?" becomes, after n rounds of interaction, "does this polynomial evaluate correctly at one random point?" The reduction is exponential -- from $2^n$ checks to $n$ rounds -- and it is the reason modern proof systems can verify in time logarithmic in the computation size.

## The Sumcheck Protocol: The Hidden Foundation

If there is one protocol that deserves to be called the backbone of modern zero-knowledge proof systems, it is the sumcheck protocol. Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan introduced it in 1992 -- decades before practical ZK systems existed. Sumcheck has since become the common thread running through every major proof system of the current era.

### What Sumcheck Does

Before stating the problem, one definition. A multilinear polynomial is one where no variable appears with degree higher than one -- for example, $g(x_1, x_2) = 3x_1 x_2 + 2x_1 + x_2 + 1$. Each variable is either present or absent in any given term, but never squared or cubed. The sumcheck protocol works naturally with multilinear polynomials because their structure matches the binary hypercube over which the sum is taken: each variable takes the value 0 or 1, so higher powers would collapse anyway (since $0^k = 0$ and $1^k = 1$). Multilinear polynomials are the native representation for most sumcheck-based proof systems, including Spartan, HyperNova, and Jolt.

The problem sumcheck solves is deceptively simple. You have a multivariate polynomial $g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ over a finite field, and you want to verify that its sum over all binary inputs equals a claimed value:

$\sum_{(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \{0,1\}^n} g(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = T$

Naively, checking this requires evaluating $g$ at all $2^n$ binary inputs. For a polynomial over 30 variables, that is a billion evaluations. Sumcheck reduces this to $n$ rounds of interaction (or, via the Fiat-Shamir transform, $n$ rounds of hash-based challenge generation), each involving a single univariate polynomial of low degree.

The protocol is interactive: the prover and verifier exchange messages in rounds. In practice, the Fiat-Shamir transform replaces the verifier's random challenges with hash outputs, making the protocol non-interactive. But the conceptual structure remains round-based.

Here is the intuition. In round 1, the prover sends a univariate polynomial $p_1(x_1)$ that claims to be the sum of $g$ over all remaining variables: $p_1(x_1) = \sum_{x_2,\ldots,x_n} g(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$. The verifier checks that $p_1(0) + p_1(1) = T$ (this ensures consistency with the claimed total), then sends a random challenge $r_1$. In round 2, the prover sends $p_2(x_2) = \sum_{x_3,\ldots,x_n} g(r_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n)$. The verifier checks $p_2(0) + p_2(1) = p_1(r_1)$, then sends another random challenge. This continues until all variables are bound to random values, at which point the verifier checks one evaluation of $g$ at the random point.

The result: verifying a sum over $2^n$ inputs reduces to checking $n$ low-degree univariate polynomials and one evaluation of $g$. For $n = 30$, that is 30 polynomial checks instead of a billion evaluations.

To make this concrete, suppose we want to verify that a polynomial $g(x_1, x_2)$ sums to $T$ over all binary inputs. There are four inputs: $g(0,0) + g(0,1) + g(1,0) + g(1,1) = T$. Instead of checking all four, the prover sends a univariate polynomial $p_1(x_1)$ that claims to be the partial sum over $x_2$. The verifier checks: does $p_1(0) + p_1(1) = T$? If yes, the verifier picks a random $r_1$ and asks for the next round. Now the prover sends $p_2(x_2)$ claiming to sum $g(r_1, x_2)$. The verifier checks $p_2(0) + p_2(1) = p_1(r_1)$. After two rounds, the verifier holds a single point $g(r_1, r_2)$ that can be checked directly. Two rounds replaced four evaluations. For $n$ variables, $n$ rounds replace $2^n$ evaluations.

This exponential compression is why sumcheck appears everywhere in modern ZK. The reduction from $2^n$ evaluations to $n$ rounds is not merely a constant-factor improvement. It is an exponential improvement -- the kind that turns impossible problems into trivial ones. For a polynomial over 100 variables, naively verifying the sum would require $2^{100}$ evaluations (more than the number of atoms in the observable universe). Sumcheck reduces this to 100 rounds. The gap between "impossible" and "trivial" is the gap that sumcheck bridges.

To see how sumcheck serves CCS specifically, consider a CCS instance with a single constraint: $M_1 \cdot \mathbf{z} \circ M_2 \cdot \mathbf{z} = M_3 \cdot \mathbf{z}$ (where $\circ$ is the Hadamard product). The verifier needs to check that this equation holds at every row. Equivalently, the verifier needs to check that the polynomial $h(x) = (M_1 \cdot \mathbf{z})(x) \cdot (M_2 \cdot \mathbf{z})(x) - (M_3 \cdot \mathbf{z})(x)$ sums to zero over all row indices. This is exactly a sumcheck instance. The prover sends the univariate restriction of $h$ in the first variable, the verifier checks its degree and evaluates at a random point, and the process recurses on the remaining variables. After $\log_2(n)$ rounds, the verifier holds a single evaluation claim that can be checked against the committed polynomials. The CCS constraint -- which could be R1CS, AIR, or PLONKish in disguise -- has been verified without the verifier ever touching the witness.

Spartan uses it for R1CS verification. HyperNova uses it for CCS folding. Jolt and Lasso use it for lookup arguments. SP1 Hypercube builds its entire polynomial stack on sumcheck. When the Ethereum Foundation's zkEVM effort evaluated proof system designs, sumcheck-based architectures won -- not because they are simplest to implement, but because the exponential reduction in verifier work is too large to ignore.

### Why Sumcheck Is Everywhere

The sumcheck protocol is the verification mechanism that makes polynomial-based arithmetization practical. Every time a modern proof system needs to verify that a polynomial identity holds over a large domain, sumcheck is how it does so.

- **Spartan** (Setty, 2019) uses sumcheck to verify R1CS satisfaction directly, without FFTs. The prover expresses the R1CS check as a multilinear polynomial sum and runs sumcheck to prove it holds.
- **HyperNova** uses sumcheck as the core of its multi-folding protocol. Folding multiple CCS instances reduces to a sumcheck instance.
- **Jolt and Lasso** reduce lookup verification to sumcheck instances. Every table lookup becomes a polynomial sum that sumcheck can verify.
- **LogUp-GKR** combines the sumcheck protocol with the GKR interactive proof to verify lookup arguments with logarithmic overhead.
- **SP1 Hypercube** (Succinct, 2025) uses sumcheck over the Boolean hypercube as its primary verification strategy.
- **Binius** (Irreducible, 2025) applies sumcheck over binary tower fields.

The sumcheck protocol is to modern ZK proof systems what the internal combustion engine was to early automobiles: the mechanism that makes the entire apparatus work, even though the user never sees it directly. Understanding that sumcheck exists, and that it reduces exponential verification to linear communication, is essential for understanding why the overhead of arithmetization is not as catastrophic as it might first appear.

A note on presentation order: this chapter covers arithmetization (Layer 4) before the proof system (Layer 5) and cryptographic primitives (Layer 6). But in practice, the causal arrow often runs the other way. The sumcheck protocol is a proof technique that shaped which arithmetization formats became practical. The field choice at Layer 6 determines which polynomial representations are efficient at Layer 4. These three layers -- field, commitment scheme, polynomial representation -- form an inseparable "proof core." We present them in the standard order, but the reader should understand that the dependency is circular, not linear.

The sumcheck protocol also illustrates a recurring theme in this book: the most important technical ideas are often invisible to the end user. A developer writing a Compact smart contract on Midnight, or a Solidity developer deploying a Groth16 verifier on Ethereum, will never interact with the sumcheck protocol directly. They will never see a multilinear polynomial or check a partial sum. But sumcheck is running underneath, silently reducing the verification cost from exponential to linear, making the entire stack practical. The seven layers of the magic trick include mechanisms that the audience never sees -- and sumcheck is the most consequential of them all.

## Lookup Arguments

In the classical approach to arithmetization, every operation in a computation is encoded as polynomial constraints. Addition and multiplication are natural: they are already arithmetic operations over the field. But what about operations that are *not* naturally arithmetic?

Consider the problem from the perspective of a circuit designer building a zkVM. The RISC-V instruction set contains 47 base instructions. Of these, roughly half are "arithmetic-friendly" -- ADD, SUB, MUL, and their variants map naturally to field operations. But the other half are "arithmetic-hostile": AND, OR, XOR, SLL (shift left logical), SRL (shift right logical), SLT (set less than), BEQ (branch if equal), and the memory load/store operations. Each of these requires bitwise decomposition or comparison logic that does not map neatly to field arithmetic.

Bitwise AND, comparison, range checks, hash functions -- these require decomposing the values into individual bits, constraining each bit to be 0 or 1, and then reconstructing the result. A single SHA-256 hash invocation can require tens of thousands of constraints.

The cost is staggering when you trace through a concrete example. Consider XOR -- the bitwise exclusive-or of two 8-bit numbers. On a CPU, this is one instruction, one clock cycle, done. In a polynomial constraint system, you must first decompose each 8-bit input into 8 individual bits (8 range-check constraints per input, 16 total), then constrain each output bit to be the XOR of the corresponding input bits (each bit-level XOR requires the polynomial $a + b - 2ab$, which is a degree-$2$ constraint, so 8 more constraints), and finally reconstruct the output from its bits (8 more constraints). That is roughly 32 constraints for an operation that takes a single machine cycle. SHA-256 calls XOR, AND, NOT, and rotation thousands of times. Multiply 32 constraints per operation by thousands of operations and you arrive at the tens of thousands of constraints that a single hash invocation demands.

This is not a fixable inefficiency in the constraint system design. It is a fundamental mismatch between the polynomial language (which speaks addition and multiplication over large fields) and the bitwise language (which speaks AND, OR, XOR over individual bits). No amount of cleverness in the constraint layout will make polynomials natively express bit manipulation. The operations live in different algebraic worlds.

The mismatch created a two-tier cost structure in early ZK systems. "Arithmetic-friendly" operations (Poseidon hash, MiMC, elliptic curve arithmetic) -- operations designed from the ground up to minimize constraint count -- were cheap. "Arithmetic-hostile" operations (SHA-256, Keccak, AES, bitwise logic) -- operations from the traditional computing world -- were expensive by comparison. This is why the ZK community designed entirely new hash functions (Poseidon, Rescue, Neptune) that use only field additions and multiplications, avoiding bitwise operations entirely. A Poseidon hash costs roughly 300 constraints in R1CS. A SHA-256 hash costs roughly 25,000 constraints. Same security level. Hundred-fold difference in proving cost. The constraint system penalizes any computation that crosses the boundary between field arithmetic and bit arithmetic.

Lookup arguments offer a fundamentally different approach: instead of encoding the operation as constraints, you look up the answer in a pre-computed table. Instead of proving *how* you computed XOR, you prove *that* your answer appears in a table of all correct XOR results. The philosophical shift is from verification-by-recomputation to verification-by-membership.

### Plookup: The First Practical Lookup (2020)

Gabizon and Williamson introduced Plookup in 2020. The idea: if you have a table of pre-approved input-output pairs (for example, all possible 8-bit XOR results), you can prove that a set of values appears in the table without recomputing the operation.

Consider that table of 8-bit XOR results. It has 256 * 256 = 65,536 entries, each of the form (a, b, a XOR b). If the prover claims that 0x3F XOR 0xA7 = 0x98, the verifier does not check the XOR. Instead, the verifier checks that the triple (0x3F, 0xA7, 0x98) appears somewhere in the table. If it does, the answer is correct -- because the table was constructed correctly, and membership in a correct table implies correctness of the result.

Plookup works by sorting the lookup values and the table entries into a single sorted sequence, then verifying the sorting through a grand product argument. If every lookup value appears in the table, the sorted sequence has a specific structure that the grand product captures. The prover merges the table and the lookup values into one sorted list, then proves that the merged list is a valid interleaving of the original table with the queried entries. A polynomial identity -- checked via a grand product over the entire sorted sequence -- catches any entry that does not belong.

The catch: sorting costs $O(n \log n)$, and the grand product requires committing to the sorted sequence. For a circuit with $n$ lookups into a table of size $T$, the prover must commit to a sorted list of length $n + T$. This makes Plookup a meaningful optimization for expensive operations (hashes, range checks) but not a universal solution. The sorting overhead is the bottleneck, and it resists parallelization -- you cannot sort half a list on one machine and half on another without a merge step.

Despite its limitations, Plookup was immediately adopted. Lookup arguments for range checks (proving a value is between $0$ and $2^N$) replaced the naive approach of decomposing into N bits and constraining each one. For a 16-bit range check, the naive approach requires 16 boolean constraints plus a reconstruction constraint (17 total). A Plookup-based range check requires one lookup into a table of 65,536 entries. The lookup is more expensive in absolute prover time (sorting overhead), but far cheaper in constraint count -- and for systems where constraint count is the bottleneck, this tradeoff is worthwhile. By 2021, every major PLONKish system used lookup arguments for range checks.

### LogUp: The Sorting-Free Revolution (2022)

Ulrich Haboeck's LogUp paper in 2022 replaced Plookup's sorting with an observation that is, in retrospect, elegant to the point of inevitability. The name "LogUp" comes from "logarithmic derivative" -- the key mathematical technique. If you have a polynomial P(X) = Product of (X - r_i) whose roots are exactly the lookup values, then the logarithmic derivative of P is P'(X)/P(X) = Sum of 1/(X - r_i). This transforms a product (which is hard to check incrementally) into a sum (which is easy to accumulate and verify). The idea comes from complex analysis, where logarithmic derivatives convert multiplicative structures into additive ones. Haboeck's insight was to apply this classical technique to the lookup problem.

Instead of sorting, LogUp observes that if every lookup value $f_i$ appears in the table $t$, then a specific identity over rational functions must hold:

$\sum_i \frac{1}{X - f_i} = \sum_j \frac{m_j}{X - t_j}$

where $m_j$ counts how many times table entry $t_j$ is looked up. The left side sums one term per lookup. The right side sums one term per table entry, weighted by the number of times it was accessed. If every lookup value is in the table, these two sums are equal as formal rational functions -- and therefore they are equal at a random evaluation point with overwhelming probability.

A tiny example makes this concrete. Suppose the table contains {1, 2, 3} and the prover claims to look up the values {2, 3, 2}. The left side (one term per lookup) is: $1/(X-2) + 1/(X-3) + 1/(X-2) = 2/(X-2) + 1/(X-3)$. The right side (one term per table entry, weighted by frequency) is: $0/(X-1) + 2/(X-2) + 1/(X-3)$ -- because entry 1 is looked up 0 times, entry 2 is looked up twice, and entry 3 is looked up once. Both sides equal $2/(X-2) + 1/(X-3)$. The identity holds. Now suppose the prover cheats and claims to look up {2, 3, 5}, where 5 is not in the table. The left side becomes $1/(X-2) + 1/(X-3) + 1/(X-5)$. No assignment of multiplicities to the table entries {1, 2, 3} can produce a term $1/(X-5)$ on the right side. The identity fails at a random evaluation point with overwhelming probability.

This transforms the lookup argument from a product check to a *sum check* -- and sums, unlike products, compose beautifully. Why does this matter? Because a product of n terms can be thrown off by a single corrupted factor (the product becomes wrong, but localizing the error requires inspecting every factor). A sum of n terms, by contrast, is naturally decomposable: you can split the sum into batches, compute partial sums independently, and aggregate them. The algebraic structure of addition is friendlier than the algebraic structure of multiplication.

The advantages are substantial:

- **No sorting required.** Eliminates the $O(n \log n)$ overhead entirely. The prover's cost drops to $O(n + T)$, linear in the number of lookups plus the table size.
- **Natural batching.** Multiple lookup tables can be handled simultaneously via random linear combinations. If your circuit uses a XOR table, an AND table, and a range-check table, LogUp handles all three in one pass.
- **Parallelizable.** The summation structure means partial lookups can be computed independently on separate machines and aggregated with a single addition. This is exactly the property that GPU-based provers exploit.
- **Sumcheck-compatible.** The rational function identity can be verified using the sumcheck protocol, connecting lookups directly to the same verification backbone that handles constraint checking.

LogUp became the production standard. It replaced Plookup in deployed systems and enabled the next generation of lookup-based architectures. The transition was rapid: by 2024, virtually every new proof system design used LogUp or a LogUp variant for its lookup needs.

### LogUp-GKR: The Verifier Gets Faster (2023)

LogUp made the prover efficient. But the verifier still had to check the rational function identity, which naively requires work proportional to the number of lookups. Papini and Haboeck combined LogUp with the GKR interactive proof protocol to solve this.

The GKR protocol provides an efficient way to verify layered arithmetic circuits -- circuits where the computation flows through layers, each layer depending only on the one before it. The fractional sum computation in LogUp (adding up all the 1/(X - f_i) terms) has exactly this layered structure: it is a sum reduction tree. LogUp-GKR applies the GKR protocol to this tree, reducing the verifier's work from linear to logarithmic in the number of lookups.

The result: logarithmic proof size and verification time for lookup arguments. The verifier does $O(\log n)$ work regardless of how many lookups the prover performed.

LogUp-GKR is now used in Polygon's Plonky3 framework and in SP1 Hypercube. It makes lookups nearly free for the verifier, which is critical for recursive proof composition -- where the verifier's circuit size directly affects the cost of the next recursion step. If verifying a lookup takes $O(n)$ work, then a recursive verifier circuit must be $O(n)$ in size, which is expensive to prove in the next recursion layer. With LogUp-GKR, the recursive verifier circuit is $O(\log n)$, making deep recursion practical.

The combination of LogUp (efficient prover) and GKR (efficient verifier) made lookups a first-class operation in the proof system -- no longer an optimization to be applied selectively, but a general-purpose tool to be used wherever a pre-computed table exists. This set the stage for the two results that completed the lookup revolution: Lasso, which made table size irrelevant, and Jolt, which made lookups the only computation paradigm needed.

### Lasso: The Table Size Disappears (2023)

The fundamental limitation of both Plookup and LogUp is that the prover must somehow touch the entire table. For a table of $2^{16}$ entries (65,536 rows), this is manageable. For a table of all possible 64-bit operations -- $2^{128}$ entries -- it is physically impossible to even store the table, let alone commit to it. The table of all 64-bit additions alone has $2^{128}$ rows. At one byte per row, that is $10^{38}$ bytes -- more than the number of atoms in the observable universe. No amount of hardware solves this.

Lasso, by Setty, Thaler, and Wahby (2023), solves this through *decomposition*. The insight is that most useful tables have internal structure that can be exploited. Specifically, if the table's multilinear extension (MLE) can be evaluated efficiently -- meaning you can compute the table's value at any point without materializing the entire table -- then each lookup can be decomposed into lookups into much smaller subtables.

The intuition is best seen through an analogy. Suppose you have a multiplication table for two-digit numbers. Instead of storing all 90 * 90 = 8,100 entries (for digits 10-99), you could decompose each two-digit number into its tens and units digits, store separate multiplication tables for single digits (only 10 * 10 = 100 entries each), and reconstruct the full product from partial products. The full table has 8,100 entries; the subtables have a combined 200 entries. You traded one large lookup for several small lookups plus some arithmetic glue. Lasso does exactly this, but for arbitrary structured tables over finite fields, using the multilinear extension as the decomposition mechanism.

For a table of size $2^{2W}$, Lasso decomposes each lookup index into $c$ chunks. Instead of one lookup into a table of size $2^{2W}$, the prover performs $c$ lookups into subtables of size $2^{2W/c}$. For 64-bit RISC-V operations with $c = 6$, each subtable has roughly $2^{22}$ entries -- about 4 million rows. That fits comfortably in memory.

The prover's cost becomes $O(n \cdot c \cdot \log(N)/c)$, which is proportional to the number of lookups (n) and the number of chunks (c), but *independent of the table size* (N). You can look up values in a table of $2^{128}$ entries without ever materializing the table. The table exists as a mathematical function -- its MLE -- not as a stored data structure. The prover only pays for the subtable entries it actually accesses.

This is the kind of result that reshapes what is considered possible. Before Lasso, "table size" was a hard constraint on lookup arguments. After Lasso, table size is irrelevant -- only table structure matters. A structured table of $2^{128}$ entries is no harder to use than a structured table of $2^{16}$ entries. The prover's work scales with the number of lookups it performs, not with the number of entries it could theoretically look up.

### Jolt: The Lookup Singularity Realized (2023)

Arun, Setty, and Thaler's Jolt paper took Lasso's theoretical framework and applied it to its logical conclusion: what if *every* instruction in a processor were a lookup?

The concept, originally proposed by Barry Whitehat as the "lookup singularity," posits that circuits should be expressed entirely as lookups into pre-computed tables. Jolt demonstrates this is achievable for a complete RISC-V instruction set:

1. Every RISC-V instruction has an evaluation table mapping inputs to outputs.
2. All instruction tables are MLE-structured (their multilinear extensions can be evaluated efficiently).
3. Lasso's decomposition makes these lookups efficient regardless of the theoretical table size.
4. Memory consistency is verified through offline memory checking (fingerprint-based techniques), not Merkle trees.

For each instruction, the prover decomposes the operands into chunks, performs lookups into small subtables (typically around 4 million entries each), and commits to roughly 18 field elements per instruction (3 per chunk, with $c = 6$ chunks).

The memory-checking component (point 4) is worth highlighting separately. In a real processor, memory is read-write: the program loads and stores values freely. Proving that every load returns the value of the most recent store to the same address is the memory consistency problem discussed in the overhead section. Jolt handles this through "offline memory checking" -- a technique where the prover computes a cryptographic fingerprint of the sequence of all reads and writes, and the verifier checks that the fingerprint is consistent with a valid read-write memory. This avoids the per-access cost of Merkle tree proofs and makes memory checking nearly as cheap as instruction checking. The technique is not specific to Jolt; it was developed by Blum et al. in the 1990s and adapted for ZK by Setty (Spartan) and others. But Jolt's integration of offline memory checking with Lasso-based instruction lookups produces a complete zkVM architecture where every component -- instruction verification, memory consistency, program counter management -- is handled by either a lookup or a fingerprint check.

The result is a zkVM where the constraint system is almost entirely lookups, with minimal arithmetic "glue." This is not an optimization applied to an existing constraint system -- it is a different paradigm for encoding computation.

Pause and consider what Jolt achieved. A complete RISC-V instruction set -- ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SRA, SLT, SLTU, BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, LW, SW, and dozens more -- expressed without writing a single arithmetic constraint by hand. Every instruction is a table lookup. The "constraint system" is a collection of tables plus the Lasso machinery to prove that every instruction's result appears in the correct table. No custom gates. No selector polynomials. No hand-optimized constraint layouts. Just tables.

To see how this works for a specific instruction, trace through a 32-bit ADD. The prover needs to prove that register_a + register_b = register_c. The "addition table" for 32-bit inputs has $2^{64}$ entries -- impossibly large to store. But Lasso decomposes each 32-bit operand into $c = 4$ chunks of 8 bits each. Each chunk lookup goes into a subtable of size $2^{16} = 65{,}536$ entries (all possible 8-bit additions, accounting for carry). The prover performs 4 small lookups instead of one impossible lookup, commits to the chunk values and the carry bits, and uses the Lasso sumcheck machinery to prove that the chunks reconstruct the full addition correctly.

Compare this to how a traditional zkVM would prove the same 32-bit ADD. In RISC Zero's earlier architecture, the prover would encode the addition as a polynomial constraint over the full 32-bit values, with range checks to ensure the operands fit in 32 bits (costing roughly 32 constraints for bit decomposition per operand), a constraint for the addition itself, and further constraints for carry propagation and overflow detection. Roughly 70 to 100 constraints per ADD instruction. In Jolt, the same instruction costs approximately 18 field element commitments (3 per chunk, 6 chunks for 64-bit RISC-V) and a handful of sumcheck rounds. The constraint count per instruction drops by roughly 4x.

This is genuinely surprising. For years, the ZK community assumed that building a practical zkVM required painstaking constraint engineering -- hand-crafting gate designs for each instruction type, optimizing selector layouts, minimizing constraint counts through algebraic tricks. Jolt demonstrates that all of that complexity can be replaced by a single, uniform mechanism: look up the answer. The engineering effort shifts from "design clever constraints" to "design decomposable tables," and the latter turns out to be systematically easier.

### The Genealogy in Full

The progression from auxiliary technique to primary computation paradigm took just three years:

| System | Year | Technique | Sorting? | Table Size Limit | Key Innovation |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Plookup | 2020 | Grand product | Yes ($O(n \log n)$) | Fixed, materializable | First practical lookup |
| LogUp | 2022 | Logarithmic derivatives | No | Fixed, materializable | Sum-based, parallelizable |
| LogUp-GKR | 2023 | LogUp + GKR | No | Fixed, materializable | Logarithmic verifier |
| Lasso | 2023 | Decomposition | No | Unlimited (structured) | Table-size independent |
| Jolt | 2023 | Lasso for full ISA | No | Unlimited (structured) | Lookup singularity realized |

The three-year progression is worth pausing on. In 2020, lookups were an auxiliary optimization -- useful for range checks and hash functions, but secondary to the main constraint system. By 2023, lookups had become a complete computation paradigm -- capable of replacing the constraint system entirely for general-purpose ISA execution. Nothing else in ZK moved this fast.

The industry has not yet fully absorbed this shift. Jolt is in alpha (open-sourced by a16z), with key missing features including full recursion support and GPU-accelerated proving. Production systems in 2026 still largely use LogUp or LogUp-GKR for specific operations (range checks, hash functions) while relying on polynomial constraints for the core computation. But the trajectory is clear: lookups are moving from a useful optimization to the primary computation paradigm.

One qualification is important. The lookup singularity works well for ISA-level computation -- adding two registers, comparing values, shifting bits. For application-specific circuits with rich algebraic structure (elliptic curve operations, pairing computations), direct polynomial constraints remain more efficient. The lookup approach excels for *general-purpose* computation; specialized circuits may still prefer custom constraints.

The lesson of the lookup revolution is about the relationship between computation and verification. The classical approach to ZK asks: "How do I re-express this computation as polynomial constraints?" The lookup approach asks a different question: "How do I prove that the answer is correct, without re-expressing the computation at all?" The table is a certificate of correctness. If the answer is in the table, the answer is correct. The proof reduces to a membership test. This conceptual shift -- from "prove the computation" to "prove membership in a table of correct answers" -- may be the most consequential shift in arithmetization since CCS unified the constraint systems. It is also, notably, the idea that connects most directly to the sumcheck protocol: LogUp's rational function identity is verified by sumcheck, Lasso's decomposition is verified by sumcheck, and Jolt's per-instruction correctness reduces to sumcheck instances. Lookups and sumcheck are two sides of the same coin.

Three advances -- CCS, sumcheck, and lookups -- form a complete verification stack. CCS provides the universal constraint format: any polynomial relation, any degree, any structure, expressed as sums of Hadamard products. Sumcheck provides the universal verification engine: any polynomial sum over an exponential domain, reduced to a single-point check in logarithmic rounds. Lookups replace the most expensive constraint-by-constraint encoding with table references: instead of proving that a value satisfies a complex relation through dozens of polynomial constraints, the prover demonstrates that the value appears in a precomputed table. Together, they answer a question that was open as recently as 2022: can we build a proof system that handles any constraint format, verifies in near-linear time, and avoids the worst overhead of hand-crafted constraint engineering? By 2024, the answer was yes -- and the combination of CCS + sumcheck + lookups is the engine inside every frontier proof system built since.

## The Overhead Tax: 10,000x to 50,000x

We have spent this chapter describing how computation is encoded as mathematics. Now we must confront the cost.

A computation that runs natively in 1 millisecond -- executing instructions directly on a processor at billions of operations per second -- takes 10 to 50 seconds to prove in a zkVM. That is an overhead of 10,000x to 50,000x. Where does this multiplier come from?

The answer is not a single bottleneck but three interlocking sources of overhead that multiply together. Each source has its own physics, its own improvement trajectory, and its own fundamental limits. Understanding the decomposition is essential because it determines which engineering improvements will matter most for which applications.

### Source 1: Field Arithmetic Encoding

Native computation uses 32-bit or 64-bit integers with hardware-accelerated arithmetic. A single addition or multiplication takes one CPU cycle -- roughly 0.3 nanoseconds on a modern processor.

ZK computation uses finite field arithmetic. If the proof system requires a 254-bit prime field (as BLS12-381 and BN254 do), every "addition" becomes multi-precision arithmetic over four 64-bit machine words. Each field multiplication requires a Barrett or Montgomery reduction. The per-operation cost is roughly 10 to 100 times higher than native integer arithmetic, depending on the field size.

The small-field revolution -- BabyBear (31-bit), Mersenne-31 (31-bit), Goldilocks (64-bit) -- addresses this directly. A 31-bit field element fits in a single 32-bit register; a 64-bit Goldilocks element fits in a single machine word. Arithmetic in these fields runs 10x to 100x faster than in 254-bit fields. But even in the smallest fields, the overhead of field arithmetic versus native integer operations remains significant.

The Mersenne-31 field is particularly elegant. Its modulus is $2^{31} - 1$, which is a Mersenne prime. Reduction modulo $2^{31} - 1$ is exceptionally fast: after computing the product of two 31-bit numbers (yielding a 62-bit result), you split the result into a high part and a low part at bit position 31, and add them together. If the sum exceeds $2^{31} - 1$, subtract once. Two shifts and two additions -- faster than any other prime modular reduction. This is why SP1 and Stwo chose Mersenne-31 as their base field: the per-operation cost is nearly as fast as native 32-bit integer arithmetic, closing the gap between "native" and "field" computation to a factor of roughly 3x to 5x.

### Source 2: Constraint Expansion

A single native instruction (say, a 64-bit addition) becomes multiple constraints in the arithmetized form. The addition itself is one constraint, but proving that the operands are within the correct range (range checks), that the memory was read correctly (memory consistency), and that the instruction was selected properly (opcode decoding) can require dozens to hundreds of additional constraints. This multiplicative blowup is the most counter-intuitive aspect of arithmetization: the "interesting" computation (the actual addition) accounts for a tiny fraction of the total constraint count. The vast majority of constraints are devoted to proving that the computational environment is correctly maintained -- that registers hold the right values, that memory is consistent, that the instruction pointer advanced correctly.

To make this tangible, here is a rough breakdown of the constraints required to prove a single ADD instruction in a typical zkVM (based on published analyses of RISC Zero and SP1 architectures):

- **Instruction decode**: the prover must prove that the opcode field of the instruction word equals the ADD opcode. This requires extracting bit fields and constraining them -- roughly 5 to 10 constraints.
- **Register read**: the prover must prove it correctly read the values of the source registers (rs1 and rs2) from the register file. Memory consistency for each read requires 3 to 5 constraints (depending on the memory-checking technique).
- **Arithmetic operation**: the actual addition is 1 constraint.
- **Overflow handling**: the result must be reduced modulo $2^{32}$ (for 32-bit RISC-V). This requires proving that the result fits in 32 bits -- a range check costing 32 constraints (one per bit) in naive approaches, or fewer with lookup-based range checks.
- **Register write**: the prover must prove it correctly wrote the result to the destination register (rd). Another 3 to 5 memory consistency constraints.
- **Program counter update**: the prover must prove that the PC advanced by 4 (the size of one instruction). 2 to 3 constraints.

Total: roughly 50 to 80 constraints for a single ADD instruction that, on a real CPU, takes one clock cycle. The arithmetic itself (the actual addition) accounts for exactly 1 of those constraints. The other 49 to 79 are bookkeeping: proving that the right values were read from the right places, that the result was stored correctly, and that the instruction was decoded properly. This bookkeeping overhead is the dominant cost in constraint expansion.

Memory consistency is particularly expensive. In a native processor, reading from memory is a single operation -- the cache or main memory returns the value, and the hardware guarantees it is the value that was most recently written to that address. The CPU does not need to *prove* this; the hardware enforces it physically. In a constraint system, there is no hardware. The prover claims "I read value 42 from address 0x1000," and the verifier has no way to check this claim without a mathematical argument.

Classical approaches use Merkle tree hashing -- roughly 300 multiplication constraints per Poseidon hash invocation -- to authenticate every memory access. The idea: maintain a Merkle tree over the entire memory state. Before each read, prove that the value at the target address is consistent with the Merkle root. After each write, update the Merkle tree and prove the new root is correct. Each access requires a Merkle proof (log-depth hash chain), and each hash costs hundreds of constraints. For a program with millions of memory accesses, this becomes the dominant cost.

Ozdemir and others have demonstrated algebraic approaches that reduce memory checking costs by 50x to 150x by replacing Merkle proofs with "offline memory checking" -- a technique where the prover accumulates a fingerprint of all reads and writes, and the verifier checks that the fingerprint is consistent at the end. No per-access Merkle proofs, just a global consistency check. This is the approach used by Jolt and by SP1's latest architecture. But even the improved methods add substantial overhead compared to native memory access, which costs exactly zero proof constraints.

### Source 3: Polynomial Commitment

After the constraints are constructed, the prover must commit to the polynomial representations and prove their evaluations. The commitment step is where the "zero-knowledge" part happens: the prover seals the polynomials into cryptographic commitments that reveal nothing about the underlying values, then proves properties of the committed polynomials without opening them. This is also, by far, the most computationally expensive step.

The commitment process typically involves Number Theoretic Transforms (NTTs) -- the finite-field analog of the Fast Fourier Transform -- which can consume up to 90% of GPU proving time. Multi-scalar multiplications (MSMs) for group-based commitments add further cost. For FRI-based systems (used with STARKs), the commitment involves building Merkle trees over polynomial evaluations and performing multiple rounds of degree-halving with random challenges. For KZG-based systems (used with PLONK and Groth16), the commitment involves computing elliptic curve group operations -- MSMs of size proportional to the polynomial degree.

The three sources multiply. If field encoding costs 10x, constraint expansion costs 50x, and polynomial commitment costs 10x, the total overhead is not $70\times$ but $5{,}000\times$. This multiplicative composition is why the overhead is so large and why improvements in any single source yield modest overall gains. Reducing field encoding overhead by 10x (moving from 254-bit to 31-bit fields) and reducing constraint expansion by 2x (using lookup-based approaches) yields a combined 20x improvement -- meaningful, but still leaving a 250x overhead. All three sources must be attacked simultaneously.

### Is the Overhead Fundamental?

No. Every source of overhead is under active attack by engineering and mathematical innovation:

- **Field size**: The shift from 254-bit to 31-bit fields reduced per-operation cost by roughly 100x. A 31-bit field multiplication is a single machine word multiply followed by a modular reduction -- roughly 2 to 3 clock cycles versus the 50 to 100 cycles required for a 254-bit Montgomery multiplication.
- **Memory checking**: Algebraic memory checking (Ozdemir et al.) reduces overhead by 50-150x versus Merkle-based approaches. Instead of hashing at every memory access, algebraic techniques use offline fingerprinting -- accumulating a running product that can be checked at the end of the execution.
- **Bit-level encoding**: Binius (Irreducible, 2025) reduces embedding overhead by 100x for bit-heavy workloads by working directly over binary tower fields, where a single bit *is* a field element (no embedding required).
- **Hardware acceleration**: GPU-based provers (BatchZK, ZKProphet) achieve throughput improvements of 10x to 100x through massive parallelism in NTT and MSM computations.
- **Lookup-based architectures**: Jolt eliminates many constraint expansion costs by replacing polynomial constraints with table lookups. The 50-80 constraints per instruction in a traditional zkVM drop to roughly 18 field element commitments per instruction.
- **Folding schemes**: Nova, HyperNova, and Neo amortize the cost of proving many similar statements by "folding" them into a single accumulated instance. Instead of proving each step independently, the prover maintains a running accumulation that grows by a constant amount per step.

The cumulative effect is multiplicative. If small fields give 100x, algebraic memory checking gives 50x, and GPU acceleration gives 10x, the combined improvement is not 160x but potentially 50,000x -- enough to close much of the gap between native and proven computation. The catch is that these improvements compound only if they apply to the same bottleneck; in practice, eliminating one bottleneck exposes the next. But the engineering trajectory points down.

### What the Overhead Feels Like in Practice

Abstract multipliers are hard to internalize. Here are three concrete examples that reveal the texture of the overhead tax.

**The single addition.** A function that adds two 64-bit integers takes approximately 1 nanosecond on a modern CPU -- one clock cycle, one instruction, done. The same addition, proven in zero knowledge, requires: encoding the addition as a field operation (the 64-bit integer must be represented as one or more field elements, with range checks to prove it fits in 64 bits), committing to the input and output values (a polynomial commitment involving a multi-scalar multiplication or hash-based Merkle path), and generating a proof that the commitment is consistent with the constraint (running the full SNARK or STARK prover pipeline). Total time: 10 to 100 microseconds, depending on the proof system. Overhead: 10,000x to 100,000x. A single addition -- the simplest possible computation -- pays the full fixed cost of the proof machinery.

**The Ethereum block.** An Ethereum block execution takes roughly 100 milliseconds of native computation: verifying signatures, executing smart contract bytecode, updating the state trie. Proving the same block in a zkEVM takes 6 to 35 seconds on GPU clusters (as reported by SP1, RISC Zero, and Succinct in 2025 benchmarks). Overhead: 60x to 350x. This is far less than the theoretical 10,000x to 50,000x because GPU parallelism and algorithmic optimizations have eaten most of the overhead for large computations. The NTTs and MSMs that dominate prover time are embarrassingly parallel -- they decompose into millions of independent operations that map naturally onto GPU architectures with thousands of cores.

**The Midnight transaction.** A Midnight shielded transfer involves a Compact smart contract that reads and updates token balances behind zero-knowledge proofs. The native computation -- checking a balance, subtracting from one account, adding to another -- would take a few microseconds in any programming language. Proving the same transaction in Midnight's ZK pipeline takes approximately 20 seconds: the Compact compiler produces ZKIR instructions, the backend lowers them to PLONKish constraints over BLS12-381, and the Halo2-style prover generates the proof. Overhead: roughly 1,000,000x if measured against the pure arithmetic of balance updates. But the comparison is misleading, because the proof is doing far more than the arithmetic -- it is proving that the balance update is consistent with the entire ledger state, that the sender has sufficient funds, that the nullifier has not been previously spent, and that the cryptographic commitments are correctly formed. The "computation" being proved is not the balance update itself but the entire integrity argument surrounding it.

**The gap between the three.** A single addition suffers 10,000x to 100,000x overhead. An Ethereum block suffers 60x to 350x. A Midnight transaction suffers a nominal 1,000,000x on the pure arithmetic but a more reasonable 1,000x when measured against the full security computation it replaces. The difference is not a measurement error. It reflects a fundamental asymmetry in the cost structure: zero-knowledge proving has large fixed costs (setting up the polynomial commitment, running the Fiat-Shamir transcript, computing the proof) and relatively small marginal costs per additional constraint. A single addition amortizes those fixed costs over one operation. An Ethereum block -- with millions of constraints -- amortizes them over millions. The per-constraint overhead might be identical, but the ratio of total proving time to native execution time drops as the computation grows.

A table makes the pattern visible:

| Computation | Native time | Proof time | Overhead | Why |
|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----|
| Single 64-bit addition | ~1 ns | 10-100 us | 10,000-100,000x | Fixed costs dominate |
| SHA-256 hash (one block) | ~300 ns | 1-10 ms | 3,000-30,000x | Constraint expansion for bitwise ops |
| Ethereum block execution | ~100 ms | 6-35 s | 60-350x | GPU parallelism amortizes fixed costs |
| Midnight shielded transfer | ~5 us (arithmetic) | ~20 s | ~4,000,000x (arithmetic) | Large cryptographic circuit, BLS12-381 field |

The key insight: overhead is not uniform. Small computations suffer disproportionately. Large computations amortize the fixed costs. Computations over large fields (BLS12-381 at 254 bits) pay more per operation than those over small fields (BabyBear at 31 bits). And computations that are inherently bitwise (hashes, comparisons) pay more than those that are inherently arithmetic (field operations, polynomial evaluations).

This is why zkVMs are viable for block-level proving (where the overhead is 100x to 500x, manageable with GPU clusters) but impractical for individual function calls (where the overhead is 10,000x to 100,000x, making a 1-microsecond function take 100 milliseconds to prove). The economics of zero-knowledge computation favor batching -- proving large computations in bulk rather than small computations one at a time.

Where does the time actually go for a block-level proof? In a typical GPU-based zkEVM prover (SP1, RISC Zero, or similar systems as measured in 2025 benchmarks), the breakdown looks roughly like this:

- **NTT (Number Theoretic Transform):** 40-60% of total proving time. The finite-field analog of the FFT, used to convert polynomials between coefficient and evaluation representations. These are the workhorses of polynomial commitment. An NTT of size $2^{24}$ involves roughly $24 \cdot 2^{24} = 400$ million field multiplications -- each of which, even in a fast 31-bit field, takes a few nanoseconds.
- **Polynomial commitment (MSM or hash-based):** 15-30% of total proving time. For KZG-based systems, multi-scalar multiplications over elliptic curves. For FRI-based systems, Merkle tree construction over hash evaluations. FRI commitments require hashing the polynomial evaluations into a Merkle tree, then performing multiple rounds of folding (each requiring NTTs of decreasing size) and opening consistency proofs.
- **Witness generation and constraint evaluation:** 10-20% of total proving time. Filling in the execution trace and checking that all constraints are satisfied. This is the "spreadsheet" work: computing the values for every cell and verifying that every rule holds.
- **Memory and communication overhead:** 5-15%. Moving data between CPU and GPU, allocating buffers, serializing proof elements. For large proofs, the witness can be several gigabytes, and transferring it across the PCIe bus takes non-trivial time.

The dominance of NTT explains why GPU parallelism helps so much: NTTs decompose into independent butterfly operations that map directly onto GPU warp-level parallelism. A single NVIDIA A100 GPU can perform NTTs over $2^{24}$ field elements in under 100 milliseconds -- a task that would take several seconds on a CPU. The algorithmic improvements from 2024 to 2026 (circle STARKs, WHIR, lattice-based schemes that avoid NTTs entirely) are systematically attacking this bottleneck.

One emerging approach avoids NTTs entirely. Sumcheck-based proof systems (like Spartan, HyperNova, and Jolt) work with multilinear polynomials over the Boolean hypercube rather than univariate polynomials over multiplicative subgroups. Multilinear polynomials do not require NTTs for evaluation or commitment. Instead, the prover performs structured summations -- which decompose into independent, parallel operations without the butterfly dependency pattern of NTTs. This is why the sumcheck-based architectures are gaining ground: they eliminate the NTT bottleneck entirely, replacing it with a computation pattern that is even more GPU-friendly.

This asymmetry also explains why recursive proof composition matters so much. If you can batch thousands of small proofs into one large proof, and then prove the large proof recursively, you move the computation into the regime where amortization works in your favor. The fixed costs are paid once; the marginal costs scale linearly. Recursion is an overhead-amortization strategy, not merely a proof-size optimization.

The implications for system design are immediate. If you are building a zkVM for general-purpose computation, you should optimize for large batch sizes: prove an entire block at once, not individual transactions. If you are building a privacy-preserving application (like Midnight), where each transaction requires its own proof, you should invest in reducing the fixed costs: smaller fields, faster commitment schemes, and more efficient constraint systems. The overhead tax is not one number. It is a function of computation size, field choice, constraint system, and proof system -- and the design space offers different tradeoffs for different applications.

The 10,000-50,000x overhead of 2024 is not a permanent feature of provable computation. It is the current state of a rapidly improving engineering frontier. A reasonable projection is that overhead will decrease to 1,000-5,000x within two to three years for general-purpose zkVMs, with application-specific circuits already achieving lower ratios. Whether it can ever approach 100x or below for general computation remains an open research question.

The trajectory is visible in the benchmarks. In 2022, proving a single Ethereum block took minutes on specialized hardware. By 2024, it took 30 to 60 seconds on GPU clusters. By early 2026, the fastest systems (SP1 Hypercube, RISC Zero 1.0) demonstrate 6 to 15 seconds for the same workload, with further improvements expected as circle STARKs, WHIR, and lattice-based commitments reach production maturity. Each generation of improvements comes from a different source: the move from 254-bit to 31-bit fields (2022-2023), the adoption of LogUp-GKR for lookups (2023-2024), the shift to sumcheck-based architectures (2024-2025), and GPU kernel optimization for NTTs and MSMs (ongoing). The overhead is falling not because of one breakthrough but because of compounding engineering progress across every layer of the stack.

For architects comparing systems, the following table normalizes the overhead by system and field, using Ethereum block proving as the benchmark workload:

| System | Base Field | Eth Block Time | Approx. Overhead | Year | Key Innovation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------|----------------|
| RISC Zero (v0.x) | BN254 (254-bit) | ~60 s (GPU) | ~50,000x | 2023 | First general-purpose zkVM |
| SP1 (v1) | BabyBear (31-bit) | ~15 s (16 GPU) | ~10,000x | 2024 | Small-field + multilinear STARK |

## Midnight's ZKIR: A Concrete Layer 4

Abstract discussions of constraint systems benefit from a concrete example. Midnight's ZKIR (Zero-Knowledge Intermediate Representation) provides one -- and it reveals that real-world arithmetization carries more structure than the mathematical formalism might suggest.

### The 24-Opcode DAG

ZKIR is not itself a constraint system. It is a typed instruction-level intermediate representation that sits *above* the constraint system in the compilation stack:

```
Compact (source language)
    |
    v
Compact IR (typed AST)
    |
    v
ZKIR (instruction DAG)  <-- This is what we are examining
    |
    v
PLONKish constraints (Halo2-style)
    |
    v
ZK proof (over BLS12-381)
```

A ZKIR circuit is a directed acyclic graph of 24 base instructions organized into eight categories:

- **Arithmetic** (3 opcodes): `add`, `mul`, `neg` -- basic field arithmetic modulo the BLS12-381 scalar field (approximately $2^{253}$). There is no subtraction opcode; the compiler implements a - b as add(a, neg(b)).
- **Constraints** (4 opcodes): `assert`, `constrain_eq`, `constrain_bits`, `constrain_to_boolean` -- the enforcement mechanism.
- **Comparison** (2 opcodes): `test_eq`, `less_than` -- produce boolean results without enforcing them.
- **Control flow** (2 opcodes): `cond_select`, `copy` -- conditional multiplexing and variable aliasing.
- **Type encoding** (3 opcodes): `reconstitute_field`, `encode`, `decode` -- type-level serialization.
- **Division** (1 opcode): `div_mod_power_of_two` -- integer-style division for byte extraction.
- **Cryptographic** (5 opcodes): `transient_hash`, `persistent_hash`, `ec_mul_generator`, `ec_mul`, `hash_to_curve` -- elliptic curve and hash operations over the Jubjub curve embedded in BLS12-381.
- **I/O** (4 opcodes): `private_input`, `public_input`, `output`, `impact` -- the boundary between circuit and ledger state.

Each instruction consumes inputs (field elements or references to earlier instruction outputs) and produces outputs. The DAG structure emerges from data dependencies: instruction i depends on instruction j if it references j's output. Variables are numbered sequentially (0, 1, 2, ...), and instructions can only reference outputs of earlier instructions.

### constrain_eq and constrain_bits: The Enforcement Backbone

Two opcodes embody the fundamental challenge of arithmetization: ensuring that abstract mathematical objects faithfully represent concrete computational values.

**constrain_eq** enforces that two field elements are identical. It produces no output. If the values differ, the circuit rejects. This is the fundamental correctness enforcement mechanism -- it appears after computations to verify results, in transcript verification to bind circuit values to on-chain state, and as the implicit check inside assertions.

There is a critical distinction between `constrain_eq` (which *enforces* equality and fails the circuit if violated) and `test_eq` (which *produces* a boolean result without enforcement). The Compact compiler uses `test_eq` for equality comparisons in program logic and `constrain_eq` for internal correctness checks. Confusing the two is precisely the kind of constraint error that causes the under-constrained vulnerabilities discussed in Chapter 3.

**constrain_bits** enforces that a field element lies within a range $[0, 2^N - 1]$. This is essential because ZKIR values are elements of the BLS12-381 scalar field -- numbers up to approximately $2^{253}$. But Compact types often have bounded ranges: `Uint<8>` must be in [0, 255], `Uint<32>` in $[0, 2^{32} - 1]$, `Boolean` must be exactly 0 or 1.

Without `constrain_bits`, a malicious prover could substitute any $253$-bit field element where an $8$-bit value was expected. If a circuit adds two `Uint<8>` values, the honest result is at most 510 -- but without range checking, a prover could claim the result is an arbitrary 253-bit number, potentially extracting value or corrupting state. Every `Uint<N>` value in compiled Compact code includes a corresponding `constrain_bits` to enforce the range constraint.

A general principle is at work: in constraint systems, everything that is *not* explicitly constrained is implicitly *allowed*. The prover will satisfy exactly the constraints you write, and nothing more. If you forget a constraint, the prover is free to exploit the gap. This is why under-constrained circuits are the dominant failure mode in ZK systems.

### Where ZKIR Sits in the Taxonomy

ZKIR's relationship to the standard constraint system taxonomy is instructive:

| Property | R1CS | AIR | PLONKish | CCS | ZKIR |
|----------|------|-----|----------|-----|------|
| Basic unit | Rank-1 constraint | Transition polynomial | Custom gate + wiring | Matrix-vector product | Typed instruction |
| Structure | Flat constraint list | Uniform trace | Gate array + permutation | Matrix equation | DAG of instructions |
| Abstraction level | Low | Low | Medium | Medium | **High** |
| Proof system binding | Groth16, Spartan | STARKs | Halo2, PLONK | Any IOP | PLONKish (via backend) |

ZKIR is not a competitor to R1CS, AIR, PLONKish, or CCS. It operates at a higher abstraction level. Each ZKIR opcode *generates* one or more underlying PLONKish constraints: `add` generates an addition gate, `mul` generates a multiplication gate, `constrain_bits` generates range-check constraints (potentially many gates for N-bit range), `ec_mul` generates a full scalar multiplication circuit (many internal gates), `persistent_hash` generates a hash circuit (many internal gates).

The ZKIR-to-PLONKish lowering is handled by the proof system backend. ZKIR documents the *semantic* layer -- what the circuit means. The actual arithmetization into PLONK gates happens below, invisible to the Compact developer.

Midnight's design philosophy becomes clear at this boundary. In Circom, the developer writes constraints directly. In SP1, the zkVM generates constraints automatically from the RISC-V execution trace. In Midnight, the Compact compiler produces ZKIR instructions that carry type information and semantic meaning (including blockchain-specific operations like ledger reads and writes), and the backend translates these into PLONKish constraints. The developer never touches the constraint system.

A ZKIR circuit could, in principle, be lowered to CCS instead of PLONKish. The typed instruction set would need to be decomposed into the matrix-vector product form that CCS requires. Whether Midnight's proof system will eventually migrate from PLONKish to CCS depends on the maturity of CCS-based proof systems and the availability of lattice-based folding schemes for production use -- a question that connects Layer 4 directly to the post-quantum considerations at Layer 6.

### The BLS12-381 Field Consequence

ZKIR operates over the BLS12-381 scalar field: a prime of approximately $2^{253}$, requiring 255 bits to represent. This is roughly 4x wider than the Goldilocks field (64-bit) used by Neo and Plonky2, and approximately 8x wider than the BabyBear (31-bit) or Mersenne-31 (31-bit) fields used by SP1, RISC Zero, and Stwo.

The large field is necessary for Midnight's architectural choices. BLS12-381 is a pairing-friendly curve, enabling KZG polynomial commitments and Groth16 verification. The Jubjub twisted Edwards curve embeds natively in BLS12-381's scalar field, enabling in-circuit elliptic curve operations for Pedersen commitments and key derivation. The mature ecosystem (Zcash, Ethereum 2.0) provides audited tooling.

But the large field is also the primary performance cost. Each field operation operates on 255-bit numbers using multi-precision arithmetic, while BabyBear or M31 operations use single-register native arithmetic. This is why Midnight's proof generation takes the order of 20 seconds per circuit (see Chapter 6 for exact measurements) -- acceptable for privacy-preserving blockchain transactions, but orders of magnitude slower than what small-field STARK systems achieve.

The field choice at Layer 6 determines the arithmetic cost at Layer 4. There is no escaping this dependency.

## Where the Layers Collapse

This chapter has presented arithmetization as a distinct layer. But the evidence from real systems shows that the boundary between Layer 4 and its neighbors is porous.

### Layers 3 and 4: Jolt's Merger

In Jolt, witness generation *is* the arithmetization. Every instruction in the execution trace is decomposed into lookups on small subtables. The decomposition happens simultaneously with trace generation -- there is no meaningful step where "first you generate the witness, then you arithmetize it." The two processes are fused.

This has concrete implications. When the Feynman analysis asked "if Layers 3 and 4 collapse into one in Jolt, does the seven-layer model actually work?", the answer is that the model is descriptive, not prescriptive. It identifies conceptual concerns (witness generation, constraint encoding) that are always present, even when the implementation fuses them.

### Layers 2 and 4: Cairo's Co-Design

Cairo, StarkWare's ZK-native language, was designed specifically so that its instruction set would map efficiently to AIR constraints. The ISA *is* the constraint system. Language design (Layer 2) was dictated by arithmetization efficiency (Layer 4).

The dependency runs opposite to the top-down model the book follows. In Cairo's case, the constraint system came first, and the language was designed to match it. Cairo's memory model is "write-once" -- once a value is written to an address, it cannot be overwritten -- because write-once memory is much cheaper to prove in AIR constraints than read-write memory. A conventional language designer would never choose a write-once memory model. But the constraint system designer knows that proving memory consistency for write-once memory requires a simple sorted-access check (much cheaper than Merkle trees or fingerprinting), so the language was shaped to match. The pedagogical order (language before arithmetization) hides a real engineering dependency. Cairo was not "compiled to" AIR; it was "born from" AIR.

### The Proof Core: Layers 4, 5, and 6

The most significant cross-layer dependency is the "proof core" -- the inseparable triad of {finite field, polynomial commitment scheme, polynomial representation} that straddles Layers 4, 5, and 6.

Choose a 31-bit field (Layer 6) and you get fast arithmetic but need FRI-based commitments (Layer 5) and AIR or multilinear representations (Layer 4). Choose a 254-bit pairing-friendly field (Layer 6) and you can use KZG commitments (Layer 5) with univariate polynomials in Lagrange basis (Layer 4). Choose a lattice-based commitment over a 64-bit Goldilocks field (Layer 6) and you get post-quantum security with CCS-native constraints (Layer 4) and sumcheck-based folding (Layer 5).

These are not three independent choices. They are one choice with three manifestations. The seven-layer model usefully separates the *concerns* (what is being encoded? how is it committed? what field operations are available?) even when the *implementations* cannot be separated.

This is the collapse we warned about in Chapter 1. The seven-layer model is a pedagogical map. The engineering territory has three layers at the proof core, not seven, and the edges between them are bidirectional. Hold both models as you read: the pedagogical stack (useful for learning each concern in isolation) and the engineering DAG (useful for building real systems). Chapter 10 will draw the honest map -- seven nodes, fourteen directed edges, no pretense of independence.

A concrete example of this coupling: RISC Zero originally used a 254-bit field with KZG commitments and R1CS constraints. In 2023, they migrated to BabyBear (31-bit field) with FRI commitments and AIR constraints. The migration was not "swap out the field and keep everything else." It required simultaneously changing the field (Layer 6), the commitment scheme (Layer 5), and the constraint format (Layer 4) -- because none of the three could be changed independently. BabyBear does not support KZG (which needs a pairing-friendly curve), and FRI does not work naturally with R1CS (which lacks the evaluation-domain structure that FRI requires). The three layers moved as a unit, confirming that the "proof core" is a single design decision dressed up as three.

---

## Where the Analogies Break

We promised at the beginning of this chapter to say where the analogies break down.

Arithmetization is the hardest layer to explain because it is the layer where computer science, algebra, and information theory collide in ways that resist simplification. The "spreadsheet with polynomial rules" captures the structure but not the mechanism. The "Sudoku puzzle" captures the constraint-satisfaction flavor but misleads about uniqueness. The "encoding" metaphor captures the transformation but hides the overhead.

What actually happens at Layer 4 is a lossy translation. A computation in the real world involves pointers, variable-length data, exceptions, floating-point approximation, and timing. The arithmetized version strips all of that away and replaces it with fixed-size field elements, fixed-structure polynomial constraints, and deterministic evaluation. The gap between the two -- the "abstraction tax" of 10,000x to 50,000x -- is the price of making computation mathematically verifiable.

Consider what is lost in the translation. A native C program uses 64-bit integers with overflow semantics (values wrap around at $2^{64}$). The arithmetized version uses field elements modulo a prime -- where overflow does not exist, because field arithmetic is always exact. To faithfully represent 64-bit overflow behavior, the constraint system must decompose the values into 64 individual bits, check that each is boolean, compute the sum, and check that only the low 64 bits are retained. The "overflow" that hardware handles in zero cycles costs dozens of constraints. Similarly, a floating-point multiplication that the CPU executes in one cycle using a dedicated FPU requires hundreds of constraints to simulate in field arithmetic -- because there is no floating-point hardware in a finite field, only integers. Every gap between native computation and field arithmetic generates constraints. The overhead is not laziness or bad engineering. It is the cost of bridging two incompatible computational models.

That price is falling. It fell when AIR replaced R1CS for VM-style computations. It fell when PLONKish introduced custom gates. It fell when CCS unified the constraint systems. It fell when LogUp eliminated sorting from lookups. It fell when Lasso made table sizes irrelevant. It fell when small fields replaced 254-bit primes. It falls every time a researcher finds a way to encode more computation in fewer constraints.

But it has not fallen to zero, and it may never fall to zero. Provable computation is inherently more expensive than unprovable computation. The magician who performs backstage with no audience can cut corners. The magician who must produce a sealed certificate -- one that any stranger can verify -- must record every step with mathematical precision. The overhead of arithmetization is the cost of making the performance verifiable.

There is a theoretical lower bound that clarifies the situation. Any computation that produces n bits of output requires at least n bits of communication to verify (you need to at least read the output). The overhead above this information-theoretic minimum comes from the cryptographic machinery: polynomial commitments, random challenge generation, and the proof that the polynomial identities hold. Whether this cryptographic overhead can be reduced to $O(1)$ multiplicative factor remains an open question. The current answer is: not yet, but the constant factor is shrinking every year.

The honest summary of Layer 4 in 2026: arithmetization is hard, expensive, and getting better fast. The constraint systems are converging toward CCS. The lookup revolution is replacing hand-crafted constraints with table lookups. The overhead is falling from 10,000x toward 1,000x and below. And the sumcheck protocol -- invented in 1992, long before anyone imagined practical zero-knowledge proofs -- has become the universal verification engine that makes it all work.

From this point forward, the magician-and-audience framing will recede. Layers 5, 6, and 7 operate at a level of abstraction where the metaphor obscures more than it reveals. The sealed certificate, the deep craft, the verdict -- these section titles keep the theatrical frame alive as a mnemonic, but the explanations will be increasingly technical. We will still speak of provers and verifiers, because those are the real actors, but the stage curtains come down here. When the metaphor returns in full force, it will be in Chapter 12, where Midnight provides a concrete theater that makes the abstraction physical again.

---

*The computation is encoded as mathematics. Every instruction, every memory access, every comparison has been transformed into polynomial equations over a finite field. The equations are organized -- as R1CS, as AIR, as PLONKish, or as CCS -- and the lookup arguments have replaced the most expensive operations with table references. The sumcheck protocol stands ready to verify that the equations hold, without checking every cell in the spreadsheet.*

*The constraint system is the scorecard. But a scorecard means nothing until someone seals it into a certificate that cannot be tampered with. The next chapter enters the proof system -- the cryptographic mechanism that seals the certificate.*

*A note on the next three chapters.* Chapters 5, 6, and 7 cover arithmetization, proof systems, and cryptographic primitives -- what this book calls the "proof core." In practice, these three layers are inseparable: the choice of field (Layer 6) determines which arithmetization works (Layer 4), which determines which proof system is viable (Layer 5). We present them sequentially because a book must be linear, but they are best understood as a single coupled design unit. If a choice in Chapter 7 seems to contradict a claim in Chapter 5, it is because the dependency runs in both directions. Read all three, then revisit.
