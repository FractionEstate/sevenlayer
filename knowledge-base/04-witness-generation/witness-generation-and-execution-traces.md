# Witness Generation and Execution Traces

This document covers Layer 3: execution traces, witness-generation costs, side-channel risks, memory constraints, and the boundary between private witness data and disclosed outputs.

*Layer 3 -- Witness Generation*

## The Hidden Bottleneck

Here is a number that should have been a scandal: 50-70%.

That is the fraction of total proving time consumed by witness generation in modern GPU-accelerated systems. Not 10-25%, as the field commonly claimed until recently. The outright majority. If witness generation accounts for more than half the cost of producing a zero-knowledge proof, why has the field treated it as a minor backstage interlude? Why have billions of dollars in optimization effort focused on the cryptographic proving step while the dominant bottleneck hid in plain sight?

The answer reveals something important about how technology communities deceive themselves. When GPU acceleration made the cryptographic proving step 10 times faster, witness generation did not get faster. It stayed the same speed. But its *share* of total time climbed from a modest 20% to a dominant 67%. The better the proof system got, the worse the witness gap became. The field celebrated its proving breakthroughs while the actual bottleneck quietly grew.

This chapter is about what happens backstage. The curtain has closed. The audience (the verifier) cannot see what the magician does next. She takes her private data -- your bank balance, your identity, your vote -- and runs the computation, recording every step. This recording is the witness: the complete execution trace. Later layers will prove properties about it without revealing its contents.

But three problems lurk behind that curtain. The recording is expensive to make. The recording room has thin walls. And if the recording is wrong, the entire system breaks.

## Execution Traces

Start with the simplest possible example. You want to prove you know a number whose square is 25. The witness is that number: 5. The proof convinces the verifier that you know such a number, without revealing that the number is 5. The verifier learns "this person knows a square root of 25." The verifier does not learn "the number is 5." (In fact, the verifier does not even learn whether you chose 5 or -5 -- both are valid witnesses for the same statement.)

Now scale up. You want to prove that an Ethereum state transition is valid -- that a block of transactions, when applied to the current state, produces the claimed new state. The witness is not a single number. It is the *entire execution trace*: every memory access, every register value, every instruction execution, every intermediate hash computation, every storage read and write. For a complex Ethereum block, this means millions of steps, each with dozens of columns of data. The execution trace for a block proved by SP1 or RISC Zero might contain billions of field elements.

The witness is, in the most literal sense, a complete recording of everything that happened during the computation. Think of it as a security camera that films the magician backstage: it captures not just the final result but every intermediate movement, every prop placement, every sleight of hand. The recording exists so that the proof system can later verify that every step was consistent with the rules -- without the verifier ever watching the footage.

Here is what a witness looks like for a trivial computation: proving that $x^2 + x = 12$ where $x = 3$.

| Step | Operation | Result |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Load x | 3 |
| 2 | $t_1 = x \times x$ | 9 |
| 3 | $t_2 = t_1 + x$ | 12 |
| 4 | Assert $t_2 = 12$ | ✓ |

Four field elements. Four rows in the trace table. Each intermediate value is a cell the prover must fill in and the constraint system must verify. For a real zkVM executing a RISC-V program, the trace has columns for every register (32 registers), the program counter, the current instruction, memory addresses accessed, and intermediate ALU results -- thousands of columns, millions of rows, but the same fundamental structure: a table where each row is one clock cycle of execution.

This distinction between the *computation* (what the magician does) and the *recording* (the witness) matters more than it looks. The computation might take milliseconds. The recording is vastly larger because it includes every intermediate value. And generating the recording -- running the computation while capturing every detail -- is the expensive part.

> The execution trace records every check: "cell (0,0) = 1, matches given? yes. Row 0 sum = 10, all distinct? yes. Column 0 = {1,3,2,4}, all distinct? yes. Box (0,0) = {1,2,3,4}, all distinct? yes." Sixteen values, plus every intermediate comparison and boolean result -- roughly 80 field elements in total. The verifier never sees this grid. The verifier sees only the original puzzle (the public input) and, eventually, the proof.

In a zkVM like SP1 or RISC Zero, witness generation means *emulating the entire RISC-V processor*. Every instruction is fetched, decoded, and executed. Every register update is recorded. Every memory access is logged. This is full virtual machine emulation, step by step, sequentially. It cannot be easily parallelized because each instruction depends on the state left by the previous instruction. The program counter moves forward one step at a time, and the witness generator must follow.

Here is why witness generation is CPU-bound. Polynomial arithmetic -- the core of the proving step -- is naturally parallel. Number-theoretic transforms, multi-scalar multiplications, and polynomial evaluations split naturally across thousands of GPU cores. But VM emulation is inherently sequential. The next instruction depends on the current instruction's result. You cannot execute instruction 1,000 before you know the outcome of instruction 999.

## Witness Generation Costs

The paper that this book revises claimed witness generation accounted for 10-25% of total proving time. That figure was approximately correct in 2023, when the proving step was slow enough to dwarf everything else. It is no longer correct.

Modern GPU-accelerated provers have transformed the cost structure. When the cryptographic proving step runs on an NVIDIA H100 GPU -- or a cluster of them -- it becomes 10 to 100 times faster than on a CPU. Multi-scalar multiplications, the traditional bottleneck, have been optimized to the point where number-theoretic transforms (NTTs) now account for up to 90% of GPU proving time. And NTTs themselves have been accelerated through pipelining, with systems like BatchZK achieving over 3,000 times speedup over CPU baselines for Merkle tree commitment operations.

But witness generation did not ride this wave. It remains CPU-bound. Sequential. Memory-intensive. Accelerate the proving step by 10x and leave witness generation unchanged, and watch the proportions shift:

Before GPU acceleration: witness generation takes 2 seconds, proving takes 8 seconds. Witness share: 20%.

After GPU acceleration: witness generation still takes 2 seconds, proving takes 0.8 seconds. Witness share: 71%.

Welcome to the Witness Gap -- and it is growing, not shrinking. Every improvement to the proving step makes the witness gap worse by proportion. The field has been optimizing the fast part and ignoring the slow part.

The numbers from recent profiling studies confirm this. ZKPOG, the first end-to-end GPU acceleration system that treats witness generation as a first-class optimization target, demonstrated that moving witness generation to the GPU can yield 3-10x speedups. But this requires different parallelization strategies than proving. Proving parallelizes naturally because polynomial arithmetic is regular and data-independent. Witness generation requires analyzing the circuit's dependency graph, topologically sorting gates to identify independent clusters, and mapping irregular computation patterns onto GPU hardware. The parallelism is there, but extracting it is harder.

BatchZK took a different approach: pipelining. Instead of generating the entire witness first and then proving, BatchZK overlaps witness generation with proof computation. The witness is generated in chunks and fed into the prover as a stream. This significantly improves GPU utilization throughout the pipeline compared to sequential approaches where the GPU sits idle during witness generation.

The most radical proposal comes from Nair, Thaler, and Zhu, who showed that the Jolt zkVM can be implemented with *streaming witness generation* -- the prover never materializes the full witness in memory. Instead, it generates witness chunks on the fly, consumes them immediately in the sum-check protocol, and discards them. Checkpoints at regular intervals enable parallel regeneration. The space requirement drops from linear in the trace length to the square root of the trace length, with less than 2x time overhead. For a computation with $2^{35}$ cycles, this means roughly 100 GB of working memory instead of terabytes.

A third approach attacks the problem from the constraint side rather than the computation side. Ozdemir, Laufer, and Boneh developed new algebraic interactive proofs for RAM consistency checking -- the process of verifying that memory reads and writes in the execution trace are consistent. Memory checking dominates zkVM witness generation cost because the standard approach (Merkle tree commitments) requires approximately $600 \cdot A \cdot \log(N)$ constraints for A accesses to N-sized memory. Each Poseidon hash in the Merkle tree costs roughly 300 field multiplications. Their approach reduces this to $3N + 2A + O(1)$ constraints -- up to 51.3x fewer for persistent memory and even more for sparse memory. By shrinking the constraint count for memory operations, this work proportionally shrinks the witness that must be generated, since memory-related witness entries often dominate the total witness size.

These are not theoretical proposals. They represent the frontier of a field that has finally recognized where the real bottleneck lives.

### The Bottleneck That Flipped

The before-and-after illustrates a pattern that recurs throughout engineering: the phenomenon where solving one problem promotes the next problem to dominance.

In 2023, a typical zero-knowledge proof for a moderately complex computation -- say, verifying a batch of Ethereum transactions -- took approximately 10 seconds end to end. Of those 10 seconds, approximately 2 seconds were spent on witness generation: emulating the virtual machine, recording every register value, logging every memory access, building the complete execution trace. The remaining 8 seconds were spent on the cryptographic proving step: computing multi-scalar exponentiations, performing number-theoretic transforms, building polynomial commitments. The witness generation share was 20%. It was a minor cost. Nobody optimized it because the proving step was the obvious target.

The field poured billions of dollars into making the proving step faster. GPU implementations replaced CPU implementations. Custom NTT kernels exploited the butterfly structure of the transform. Batched MSM algorithms amortized curve operations across thousands of scalar multiplications. Pipeline architectures overlapped memory transfers with computation. It worked. By 2025, GPU acceleration had reduced the proving step from 8 seconds to 0.8 seconds -- a 10x improvement, and some systems achieved 100x.

Witness generation was still 2 seconds.

The arithmetic is pitiless. Before: 2 / (2 + 8) = 20%. After: 2 / (2 + 0.8) = 71%. The proving step had become a solved problem. The witness step had become the problem. And the worse the proving step got (in the sense of "faster"), the more dominant the witness step became. At 100x GPU acceleration, the proving step drops to 0.08 seconds, and witness generation accounts for 96% of total time. At that point, further GPU optimization yields approximately zero improvement to the end-to-end latency. You could make the proving step infinitely fast and the proof would still take 2 seconds.

This is Amdahl's Law applied to zero-knowledge proofs. Amdahl's Law states that the speedup of a program is limited by the fraction of the program that cannot be parallelized. If witness generation accounts for 71% of total time and cannot be parallelized (because VM emulation is inherently sequential), then even infinite parallelization of the remaining 29% yields at most a 3.4x overall speedup. The bottleneck is not a bottleneck you can throw hardware at. It is a bottleneck in the structure of the computation itself.

### Why Witness Generation Resists Parallelization

The reason witness generation is sequential is not an accident of implementation. It is a consequence of what witness generation *is*.

Consider a RISC-V program executing inside a zkVM. Each instruction reads from registers, performs an operation, and writes the result to a register. The next instruction reads from registers that may have been written by the previous instruction. The program counter advances by one. Branches depend on comparison results that were just computed. Memory loads depend on addresses that were just calculated.

This is a dependency chain. Instruction 1000 cannot execute before instruction 999 because instruction 1000 might read a register that instruction 999 wrote. Instruction 999 cannot execute before instruction 998 for the same reason. The entire execution trace is a single sequential thread of dependencies, from the first instruction to the last.

Compare this to the proving step. A number-theoretic transform operates on a vector of field elements. Each butterfly operation in the transform reads two elements, computes two outputs, and writes them back. The butterfly operations within a single stage of the transform are *independent* -- they read and write disjoint memory locations. This means they can execute in parallel across thousands of GPU cores. The parallelism is not extracted by clever engineering; it is inherent in the mathematical structure of the transform.

Witness generation has no such structure. The "butterfly" of VM emulation is a single instruction, and each instruction depends on the previous one. There is no way to execute instruction 1000 before instruction 999 completes, because you do not know what instruction 1000 *is* until instruction 999 has updated the program counter. A branch instruction at position 999 could send execution to position 1000 or to position 5000 or anywhere else. You cannot know until the branch condition is evaluated.

This is why three different research groups attacked the problem from three different angles -- each targeting a different dimension of the sequential bottleneck.

**Pipelining (BatchZK).** Instead of generating the entire witness first and then proving, BatchZK overlaps the two phases. The witness is generated in chunks: the first chunk of the execution trace is produced, then immediately fed to the GPU prover while the CPU generates the next chunk. The GPU is never idle. The CPU is never idle. The total wall-clock time drops because the two phases execute concurrently. But the witness generation itself is not faster -- only the overlap is new. Pipelining does not solve the sequential bottleneck; it hides it behind the proving step.

**Streaming (Nair, Thaler, Zhu).** The streaming approach attacks the memory dimension. Instead of materializing the full witness -- which for large computations can require hundreds of gigabytes of RAM -- the streaming prover generates witness chunks on demand, feeds them into the sum-check protocol, and discards them. Checkpoints at regular intervals (every $\sqrt{T}$ steps) allow the prover to restart from any checkpoint, enabling a form of parallelism: different proving threads can work on different segments of the trace, each regenerating its segment from the nearest checkpoint. The space requirement drops from $O(T)$ to $O(\sqrt{T})$, and the time overhead is less than 2x. For a computation with $2^{35}$ cycles, this means roughly 100 GB of working memory instead of terabytes.

**Algebraic RAM reduction (Ozdemir, Laufer, Boneh).** The most radical approach does not try to make witness generation faster or smaller. It tries to make the witness *simpler*. Memory checking -- verifying that memory reads and writes in the execution trace are consistent -- is the dominant cost in zkVM witness generation because the standard approach uses Merkle trees. Each memory access requires a Poseidon hash, and each Poseidon hash costs approximately 300 field multiplications. For a program with A memory accesses to N-sized memory, the standard approach requires approximately $600 \cdot A \cdot \log(N)$ constraints. Ozdemir et al. replace Merkle tree checking with algebraic interactive proofs that require only $3N + 2A + O(1)$ constraints -- up to 51.3x fewer. Fewer constraints means a smaller witness for the memory-checking portion, which often dominates the total witness.

Each approach has trade-offs. Pipelining requires careful synchronization between the CPU witness generator and the GPU prover. Streaming requires checkpoint management and sacrifices some proving speed for memory savings. Algebraic RAM reduction requires new interactive proof protocols that are not yet implemented in production systems. But together, they represent the first serious engineering effort to close the witness gap -- the gap that the field spent years ignoring because the proving step was the shinier problem.

The key performance numbers tell the story:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Witness generation share (with GPU proving) | 50-70% of total time | ZKPOG |
| NTT share of GPU proving time | up to 90% | ZKProphet |
| GPU pipeline speedup over CPU (sum-check protocol) | 3,040x | BatchZK |
| GPU pipeline speedup over CPU (Merkle tree) | 793x | BatchZK |
| GPU pipeline memory per proof | 0.08-0.44 GB | BatchZK |
| Streaming prover space reduction | $O(\sqrt{KT})$ | Nair et al. |
| RAM constraint reduction | up to 51.3x | Ozdemir et al. |
| ZKPOG end-to-end GPU speedup | 22.8x average | ZKPOG |

## Memory: The Binding Constraint

The Witness Gap is also a memory problem.

GPU proving requires a minimum of 24 GB of VRAM -- which excludes every consumer GPU below the NVIDIA RTX 4090 (approximately $2,000). Large computations demand far more. Jolt and ZKM can require 128 GB of system RAM. Groth16 for circuits with $2^{25}$ constraints needs approximately 200 GB of RAM. An Ethereum block execution trace, with its millions of state accesses and storage operations, can require specialized hardware with 512 GB or more.

These are not abstract numbers. They determine who can generate proofs and who cannot.

If you are a rollup operator running a proving cluster in a data center with 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs and dual-socket servers with 512 GB of RAM, the memory requirements are a budgeted operating expense. You buy the hardware, you run the provers, you amortize the cost across millions of transactions.

But if you are an individual user generating proofs on your own device -- the scenario that provides maximum privacy, because your private data never leaves your machine -- the memory requirements become a barrier to entry. A laptop with 16 GB of RAM cannot generate proofs for non-trivial computations. A phone cannot even attempt it.

This leads to an uncomfortable conclusion, and it deserves to land with full force: *privacy is, in part, a luxury good*. The privacy-maximizing architecture (client-side proving, where your secrets never leave your device) requires hardware that most people do not own. The privacy-minimizing architecture (delegated proving, where you send your private data to a proving service) works on any device but requires trusting the service with your secrets.

Read that again. The architecture that protects your data the most demands hardware that costs the most. The architecture that exposes your data to third parties is the one available to everyone. This is not a theoretical concern. It is the economic structure of privacy in 2026, and it should disturb anyone who believes privacy is a right rather than a commodity.

### The Hardware Ladder

The abstract claim becomes concrete when you map it to specific hardware tiers. Here is what zero-knowledge proving looks like at each rung of the hardware ladder, from the bottom up.

**Tier 1: A laptop with 16 GB of RAM (~$800-1,500).** You can prove trivial computations -- a few thousand constraints, the kind found in simple identity attestations or basic Merkle membership proofs. Anything resembling a real application (a token transfer with privacy, a complex smart contract execution, a state transition proof) exceeds your memory budget. The witness alone may require more RAM than you have. At this tier, you must delegate proving to a remote service. Your private data -- the witness, which contains every secret the proof is supposed to protect -- leaves your machine. You are trusting someone else's hardware with your secrets.

**Tier 2: An NVIDIA RTX 4090 with 24 GB VRAM (~$2,000 for the GPU alone, ~$4,000 for a workstation that can host it).** You can prove moderately complex circuits locally. This is the minimum hardware for client-side privacy-preserving proofs of meaningful complexity. ZKPOG targets this tier explicitly, arguing that it represents the frontier of "democratized" proving. Midnight's proof server targets similar hardware. At this tier, your secrets stay on your machine. You have genuine privacy. But you have also spent $4,000 on a workstation, which places you in the top 5% of computing hardware ownership globally.

**Tier 3: A data center server with an NVIDIA H100 GPU, 80 GB of HBM3 memory (~$30,000 for the GPU, ~$50,000-80,000 for a server).** You can prove Ethereum blocks in real time. You can run a rollup's proving infrastructure. You can handle the most complex circuits that production systems generate today. This is the rollup operator tier -- the hardware that Succinct, RISC Zero, and other proving services deploy. The H100's HBM3 provides 3.35 TB/s of memory bandwidth, which is the binding constraint for NTT performance at large polynomial sizes. No consumer GPU comes close.

**Tier 4: A cluster of 16 NVIDIA H100 GPUs (~$500,000 for the GPUs alone, ~$1 million or more for the full cluster with networking, cooling, and redundancy).** You can prove the most complex computations that exist in the ZK ecosystem: large zkVM programs with billions of cycles, full Ethereum block proofs with all precompiles, recursive proof compositions with deep nesting. This is the proving-as-a-service tier. Companies like Succinct and Gevulot operate at this level. A single proof that would take an RTX 4090 several minutes completes in seconds when the computation is sharded across 16 H100s with high-bandwidth interconnect.

**Tier 0: A smartphone with 4-8 GB of RAM (~$200-800).** This is what most of the world actually owns. At this tier, zero-knowledge proving of any meaningful complexity is not slow -- it is impossible. The memory is insufficient. The compute is insufficient. The thermal envelope is insufficient. A phone cannot generate a ZK proof for a shielded transaction, a private vote, or a verifiable computation of any significant size. Not "cannot generate it quickly" -- cannot generate it at all.

The uncomfortable math: approximately 5.5 billion people on Earth own a smartphone. Approximately 200 million own a desktop or laptop with a discrete GPU capable of ZK proving. Of those, perhaps 10-20 million own hardware at Tier 2 or above. That means roughly 95% of the world's population -- including nearly all smartphone-only users in developing economies -- cannot perform client-side ZK proving. They must delegate. They must trust. The cryptographic guarantee of privacy is available to them only through the intermediation of someone else's hardware.

This is not a bug in the technology. It is a structural feature of the cost curve. Moore's Law may eventually bring proving hardware to lower price points. Algorithmic improvements (streaming provers, algebraic RAM reduction) may lower the hardware floor. But in 2026, the privacy hierarchy is clear: the richer your hardware, the more private your computation. The poorer your hardware, the more you must trust others with your secrets.

There is a historical parallel. In the 1990s, strong encryption was classified as a munition by the United States government. Export-grade encryption was deliberately weakened to 40-bit keys, ensuring that only domestic users (and the NSA) had access to real cryptographic security. The rest of the world got a pantomime of privacy. The "Crypto Wars" ended when the government relented and strong encryption became universally available. The current ZK hardware barrier is not a government restriction -- it is an economic one. But the effect is similar: strong privacy for the few, weak privacy (or no privacy) for the many. Whether this barrier will fall, as the export restrictions did, depends on whether the field can make proving cheap enough to run on the hardware that people actually own.

The field is aware of this tension. ZKPOG specifically targets the NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24 GB VRAM, approximately $2,000) as its hardware platform, arguing that democratizing ZK proving requires targeting accessible consumer hardware rather than data center GPUs. Streaming witness generation reduces memory requirements at the cost of additional computation. And proof delegation with trusted execution environments (TEEs) offers a middle path -- your data is processed inside a secure enclave that even the hardware operator cannot inspect. But TEEs have their own vulnerability history (Foreshadow, AEPIC Leak, Downfall), and Intel deprecated SGX on consumer processors in 2021.

The memory constraint also interacts with NTT performance in a way that matters for system design. NTT -- the number-theoretic transform used in polynomial commitment schemes -- is memory-bandwidth-limited at large sizes. The butterfly structure of the NTT requires global memory accesses with poor locality in later stages, meaning that the speed of proving is ultimately limited not by compute (FLOPS) but by memory bandwidth (GB/s). HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) on data center GPUs provides the bandwidth; consumer GPUs do not.

For a system architect making infrastructure decisions, the takeaway is this: when evaluating ZK proving solutions, ask about memory, not just speed. A system that generates proofs in 3 seconds but requires 256 GB of RAM is not the same as a system that generates proofs in 10 seconds but runs in 32 GB. The first requires a data center. The second runs on a workstation. A proving service that advertises "sub-second proofs" but requires an H100 cluster is making a different claim than one that advertises "ten-second proofs" on consumer hardware.

The memory question also intersects with the privacy question. If client-side proving requires 24 GB of VRAM, and only data center GPUs and the NVIDIA RTX 4090 have that much, then privacy-preserving client-side proving is available to a narrow slice of users. Everyone else must delegate proving to a service, which means sending their private witness to someone else's hardware. The Midnight architecture partially addresses this by running the proof server locally alongside the dApp -- but "locally" still means "on hardware with sufficient resources." The 18-24 second proof generation time observed on Midnight's development environment reflects desktop-class hardware. On a mobile device, the same computation might be infeasible.

## Side-Channel Attacks: When the Walls Leak

The mathematical definition of zero-knowledge is precise: the proof reveals nothing about the witness beyond the truth of the statement being proved. But the mathematical definition describes the *proof*. It does not describe the *process of generating the proof*.

The process can leak.

The most vivid demonstration came in a 2020 USENIX Security paper by Tramer, Boneh, and Paterson. They showed that Zcash's Groth16 prover leaked information about transaction amounts through proof generation time. The attack was simple in concept: the prover's multi-scalar exponentiation (MSM) implementation optimized away terms where the witness coefficient was zero. More zeros in the binary representation of the transaction amount meant fewer curve multiplications, which meant faster proof generation. By measuring how long proof generation took -- remotely, across the network -- an attacker could estimate the Hamming weight of the transaction amount.

The correlation coefficient was R = 0.57. Not perfect, but far from zero. A timing measurement that should have been meaningless -- how long did the proof take? -- revealed information about the secret that the proof was supposed to protect.

Monero's Bulletproofs implementation was safe. The correlation was R = 0.04 -- essentially noise. The difference was architectural: Bulletproofs operates on both the binary decomposition of the amount *and its complement*, making the number of curve operations constant regardless of the value. The proof generation time was the same whether the amount was 1 or 1,000,000. Constant-time implementation is not an optimization. It is a security requirement.

### The Zcash Timing Attack: A Detective Story

The Zcash attack deserves to be told as the detective story it was, because the investigative method reveals how side-channel analysis works in practice -- and why it is so difficult to defend against.

The researchers began with a hypothesis: if the Groth16 prover's multi-scalar exponentiation skips zero-valued scalar multiplications, then the proof generation time should correlate with the number of nonzero bits in the witness. They did not need to break any cryptography. They did not need to find a flaw in the mathematics. They needed a stopwatch.

They set up a Zcash node and generated shielded transactions with known amounts. For each transaction, they measured the wall-clock time of the `r1cs_gg_ppzksnark_prover` function -- the core Groth16 proving routine in libsnark. They varied the transaction amount systematically, from round numbers like 1.000 ZEC (which has a simple binary representation with many trailing zeros) to numbers with many nonzero digits like 1.337 ZEC (which has a denser binary representation).

The pattern emerged immediately. Round numbers produced faster proofs. Dense numbers produced slower proofs. The relationship was not subtle. A transaction of exactly 1.000 ZEC generated a proof measurably faster than a transaction of 1.337 ZEC, because the scalar representation of 1.000 ZEC in the finite field contained more zero coefficients, and each zero coefficient allowed the MSM algorithm to skip a point addition.

The correlation coefficient was R = 0.57 -- not strong enough to determine the exact amount, but strong enough to distinguish broad categories. An attacker could not tell whether you sent 1.337 ZEC or 1.338 ZEC. But the attacker could distinguish "approximately 1 ZEC" from "approximately 100 ZEC" with meaningful confidence. The "zero-knowledge" proof leaked the order of magnitude of the transaction amount through the duration of its generation.

What makes this attack memorable is not its severity -- R = 0.57 is a partial leak, not a catastrophic one -- but what it reveals about the gap between mathematical proof and physical implementation. The Groth16 proof system is provably zero-knowledge. The mathematical proof of this property is correct. The implementation of the prover was not constant-time, and so the *process* of generating the proof leaked information that the *proof itself* was mathematically guaranteed to conceal. The proof was zero-knowledge. The prover was not.

The fix was straightforward: replace the variable-time MSM with a constant-time implementation that processes all scalar coefficients identically, whether they are zero or nonzero. The constant-time version is slower -- it performs multiplications that the variable-time version skips -- but it eliminates the timing channel. Zcash implemented this fix. The performance cost was real. The privacy gain was essential.

### The Poseidon Cache-Timing Attack

The second attack class is subtler, and in some ways more disturbing, because it targets a component that was specifically designed for zero-knowledge systems.

Poseidon is an "algebraic" hash function. Unlike SHA-256, which was designed for general-purpose hashing and happens to be usable (expensively) inside ZK circuits, Poseidon was built from the ground up to minimize the number of constraints required to express its computation as a polynomial relation. Where SHA-256 requires approximately 25,000 constraints per hash in a Groth16 circuit, Poseidon requires approximately 300. This 80x reduction in constraint count translates directly into faster proving and smaller proofs. Poseidon is, by design, the ideal hash function for zero-knowledge systems. Every major ZK project uses it or a close variant.

But Poseidon's S-box -- the nonlinear component that provides cryptographic security -- involves computing $x^5$ (or $x^7$, depending on the variant) over a large prime field. In software, this is typically implemented using lookup tables that map input values to output values. The S-box computation accesses these tables at indices determined by the internal state of the hash, which depends on the secret input being hashed.

This is where cache timing enters. Modern CPUs use a hierarchy of caches (L1, L2, L3) to speed up memory access. When a program accesses a memory location, the CPU loads the surrounding cache line (typically 64 bytes) into the L1 cache. Subsequent accesses to the same cache line are fast (a few cycles). Accesses to different cache lines that map to the same cache set can evict earlier entries, making them slow again (hundreds of cycles).

An attacker sharing the same physical CPU -- a realistic scenario in cloud computing environments where virtual machines share hardware -- can observe which cache lines the victim's Poseidon computation accesses. The attacker primes the cache (fills it with known data), waits for the victim's hash computation to execute, then probes the cache to see which of the attacker's entries were evicted. The eviction pattern reveals which table entries the victim accessed, which reveals information about the internal state of the hash, which reveals information about the secret input.

The hash function was designed to be ZK-friendly in algebra. It was not designed to be constant-time in hardware. The algebraic design and the implementation security were treated as separate concerns, and the gap between them is exploitable.

This is not hypothetical. Cache-timing attacks are a well-studied attack class with decades of published results against AES, RSA, and other cryptographic primitives. The novelty of Mukherjee et al.'s work is showing that the same attack class applies to ZK-specific constructions -- and that the ZK community's emphasis on algebraic efficiency has, in some cases, actively increased vulnerability by encouraging table-based designs.

### The Electromagnetic Channel

The third attack class operates at a physical level that most software engineers never consider.

Every electronic circuit, when it operates, produces electromagnetic emanations. A transistor switching from 0 to 1 consumes a different amount of current than a transistor remaining at 0. This current difference creates a magnetic field that propagates outward from the chip. The field is weak -- microwatts -- but it is measurable with equipment that costs a few hundred dollars: a near-field electromagnetic probe, a low-noise amplifier, and a digital oscilloscope.

Field operations in elliptic curve arithmetic are particularly vulnerable. When a prover computes a point addition on an elliptic curve, the specific operations performed (and their power consumption) depend on the coordinates of the points being added, which depend on the witness values. A modular multiplication where both operands are large consumes more power than one where an operand is small. A conditional branch (reduce or do not reduce after multiplication) produces a different electromagnetic signature depending on which path is taken.

Measuring these emanations from a few centimeters away -- close enough to touch the device but not close enough to require physical modification -- can reconstruct the scalar values used in multi-scalar exponentiation. This means reconstructing the witness coefficients. This means reconstructing the private inputs to the proof.

This is not science fiction. Electromagnetic side-channel attacks are a published, demonstrated attack class. They have been used to extract AES keys from smartcards, RSA private keys from laptops, and ECDSA signing keys from hardware security modules. The equipment required is modest: a near-field probe ($50-200), an amplifier ($100-500), and an oscilloscope ($500-5,000). A university research lab can mount this attack. A well-funded adversary can mount it from across a room using more sensitive antennas.

For zero-knowledge provers running on commodity hardware -- laptops, desktops, even data center servers without electromagnetic shielding -- the EM channel is an open question. No major ZK implementation has published an electromagnetic side-channel analysis. The attack surface is real, the equipment is cheap, and the countermeasures (electromagnetic shielding, randomized execution ordering, amplitude-flattening power regulation) are not part of any ZK prover's design requirements.

The three attack channels -- timing, cache, electromagnetic -- form a hierarchy of increasing physical intimacy. Timing attacks can be mounted remotely, across a network. Cache attacks require co-location on the same physical machine. Electromagnetic attacks require physical proximity to the hardware. But all three extract information from the same fundamental source: the fact that computation is a physical process, and physical processes leave physical traces. The mathematical abstraction of a zero-knowledge proof exists in a world of pure information. The implementation exists in a world of transistors, cache lines, and electromagnetic fields. The gap between those worlds is where privacy leaks.

The attack extended beyond timing. Mukherjee, Rechberger, and Schofnegger published the first systematic study of cache timing leakages in zero-knowledge protocols in 2024. They examined ZK-friendly hash functions (Poseidon, Reinforced Concrete, Tip5, Monolith) and popular proof systems (Groth16, Plonky2, Plonky3, halo2, Circle STARKs). Here is what they found.

ZK-friendly hash functions were designed for *algebraic* efficiency -- they minimize the number of constraints required to express a hash computation inside a circuit. But nobody designed them for *implementation* security. Reinforced Concrete uses large lookup tables (256 KB for its Bars function) indexed by secret-dependent data. These table lookups create cache access patterns that vary with the secret. In a shared cloud environment, where the attacker runs on the same physical machine as the prover, these cache patterns are observable.

The irony cuts deep: the move toward lookup-based designs in ZK hash functions -- motivated by the algebraic efficiency gains that Lasso and Jolt demonstrated -- actively increases the side-channel attack surface. The very optimization that makes proving faster makes the proving process less private.

Field arithmetic itself leaks. The Goldilocks field ($2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$) uses conditional reductions after arithmetic operations. If the result exceeds the modulus, a reduction step is needed; if not, it is skipped. This conditional branch creates a timing signal. Assembly implementations with branch-free code mitigate this, but many deployed field arithmetic libraries use branch-dependent paths for performance.

The accurate assessment: "zero-knowledge" is a mathematical property of the *proof*. Implementation zero-knowledge depends on the hardware, the operating system, the runtime, and the network. The gap between "the proof reveals nothing" and "the timing reveals everything" is the gap between theory and practice. The backstage walls are thinner than the magician thinks.

For defensive implementation, the standard is clear:

- No zero-skipping optimizations in multi-scalar exponentiation.
- No secret-dependent table lookups in hash functions.
- Branch-free field arithmetic, especially for conditional reduction steps.
- Cache-aligned memory access patterns.
- Constant-time prover implementations throughout the pipeline.

These requirements conflict with performance optimization at almost every turn. Making a prover constant-time means foregoing shortcuts that can halve computation time. The tension between proving speed and implementation privacy is real and ongoing.

The interaction between side channels and GPU proving adds another dimension. GPU architectures use SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) execution, where groups of 32 threads (warps on NVIDIA hardware) execute the same instruction simultaneously. Constant-time code requires all threads in a warp to follow the same execution path. When some threads need a conditional reduction and others do not, the warp must execute both paths, with inactive threads masking their results. This "thread divergence" reduces GPU utilization -- the very parallelism that makes GPUs fast for proving works against the constant-time requirement.

The open question is whether witness generation can be made fully constant-time on GPUs without unacceptable performance loss. The answer is not yet clear. What is clear is that any system claiming both GPU-accelerated proving and zero-knowledge must address this tension explicitly. Most do not.

For the reader who wants a single mental model: the backstage walls are made of different materials at different heights. The cryptographic walls (the proof itself) are mathematically perfect -- no information passes through. The implementation walls (the proving process) are made of timing signals, cache patterns, and memory access traces. They leak. Not catastrophically, not in every deployment, but measurably and exploitably in the wrong environment. The system architect's job is not to eliminate all leakage -- that may be impossible -- but to understand where the walls are thin and what information an attacker on the other side could extract.

## Witness-Constraint Divergence

The witness is not just the most expensive artifact in the ZK pipeline. It is also the most dangerous place for bugs.

Remember the dual-track problem from Chapter 3: in many ZK systems, the witness generator and the constraint system are two separate programs that must compute identical functions on all inputs. When they disagree, the result is either a soundness bug (the proof system accepts false statements) or a completeness bug (the proof system rejects true statements). Both are bad. Soundness bugs are worse.

Two real-world examples illustrate the stakes.

RISC Zero disclosed CVE-2025-52484: a missing constraint in the RISC-V circuit that allowed confusion between the rs1 and rs2 register operands. The witness generator computed the correct values for both registers. The constraint system did not enforce that the registers were distinct. A malicious prover could substitute one register for another, and the proof would still verify. The computation would appear valid -- the proof would pass -- but the result would be wrong.

The zkSync Era MemoryWriteQuery bug was worse. The struct that handled memory write operations failed to call `lc.enforce_zero(cs)` on the highest 128 bits of a 256-bit value, leaving those bits unconstrained. A malicious prover could modify the highest 128 bits of any memory write -- including withdrawal amounts. The proof system would accept the modification. An attacker could change a withdrawal of 0.00002 ETH to a withdrawal of 100,000 ETH, and the proof would verify.

These bugs share a common structure: the witness was correct, but the constraints were insufficient. The magician performed the trick honestly backstage, but the constraint system's description of what "honest" meant was incomplete. The proof certified that the computation matched the constraints. The constraints did not match the intended computation.

Call it the correctness gap: the distance between what the developer meant and what the constraints actually enforce. It is measured not in bits of security but in lines of code that were not written.

Multiple valid witnesses can exist for the same statement, and the proof system does not care which one the prover uses. If you prove that you know a square root of 25, the proof system accepts whether you use 5 or -5. This is by design -- the proof system guarantees soundness (you cannot prove a false statement), not uniqueness (there is only one valid witness).

This property -- that multiple valid witnesses exist -- is fundamental, not a bug. The proof system guarantees that the prover knows *some* valid witness. It does not guarantee which one. For most applications, this is exactly right: if you prove you know a valid password, it does not matter whether you know the first password in the hash table or the last.

Non-deterministic hints exploit this deliberately. Instead of computing a square root step by step -- which is expensive inside a circuit -- the prover *guesses* the answer (as a witness value) and the circuit verifies that the square of the guess equals 25. The computation goes from expensive (sequential square root algorithm) to cheap (one multiplication and one comparison). This "guess and check" pattern is a standard programming technique in ZK systems, not a bug. But it requires that the checking constraints are complete. If the check only verifies $x \cdot x = 25$ without constraining that x is in the correct range, a malicious prover might find a field element that satisfies the equation but is not the intended square root.

## The `disclose()` Boundary: Midnight's Witness Architecture

Midnight's approach to witness generation illustrates both the power and the subtlety of the witness/circuit separation.

In Compact, the two worlds are sharply delineated:

| Property | Witnesses | Circuits |
|---|---|---|
| Where they run | Off-chain (user's browser or node) | Compiled to ZKIR, proven locally, verified on-chain |
| What they can do | Arbitrary computation (JavaScript) | Only ZK-provable computation (field arithmetic, hashing, comparisons) |
| What they access | Private state, external APIs, databases | Only circuit inputs (public and disclosed private values) |
| Privacy | Completely private -- never leaves the device | Proven but not revealed |

Witness functions are *declared* in Compact but *implemented* in TypeScript:

```typescript
witness get_secret(): Bytes<32>;  // declared in Compact
```

```javascript
// implemented in TypeScript
const witnesses = {
  get_secret: (ctx) => [ctx.privateState, secretKey]
};
```

Each witness function receives the current context -- including a `privateState` object that persists across invocations -- and returns a tuple of the updated private state and the witness value. This means witnesses can maintain state, query external services, read databases, and perform arbitrary computation. They are full JavaScript programs, not circuit-compatible snippets.

The `disclose()` operator is the *sole gateway* from the witness world to the circuit world. Without it, witness values are invisible to the circuit, the proof, and the chain. With it, the value enters the circuit as a `private_input` in the ZKIR -- the verifier never sees the value, but the constraints verify properties about it.

The compiled ZKIR circuit has two transcript channels that encode this separation physically:

The `publicTranscript` records every ledger operation -- reads, writes, comparisons -- as a sequence of VM operations. The on-chain verifier sees this transcript and checks that it is consistent with the proof. If the developer's circuit reads a counter value from the ledger, that read appears in the public transcript. If the circuit increments the counter, that increment appears. The public transcript is the complete audit trail of on-chain state changes.

The `privateTranscriptOutputs` contains the witness values that entered the circuit through `disclose()`. Only the prover sees these. They are consumed during proof generation by `private_input` instructions in the ZKIR and then discarded. The ZKIR checker verifies that both transcripts are fully consumed -- no extra values, no missing values, no tampering.

This two-transcript model achieves something precise: the verifier knows *what changed* on the ledger (from the public transcript) and is convinced that the changes are valid (from the ZK proof), but does not know *why* the changes were made (the private inputs that drove the computation). The "what" is public. The "why" is private.

In practice, the pipeline for a Midnight transaction involves four sequential steps:

1. `contracts.callTx()` reads current ledger state via the indexer, executes the circuit locally with current state and private witnesses, and produces an unproven transaction.

2. `proofProvider.proveTx()` generates the ZK proof -- the dominant latency step, as detailed in Chapter 6 -- producing a proven transaction.

3. `walletProvider.balanceTx()` binds the transaction, runs token balancing (unshielded, shielded, and dust), signs UTXO inputs with BIP-340 Schnorr signatures, and merges the balancing transaction with the original.

4. `midnightProvider.submitTx()` submits to the blockchain, where the node verifies the ZK proof, checks that the public transcript matches the ledger state, and applies the state transition.

At no point do witnesses cross the network. The developer guide states this explicitly: "Witnesses stay local. Never sent to chain."

The side-channel implications matter here. Proof generation takes a fixed amount of time regardless of witness values -- dominated by the cryptographic proving step, not the witness computation. This provides natural but unintentional timing uniformity: the fixed cost of proof generation drowns out any timing variation in witness computation. But the documentation does not address cache timing, network timing (when a user queries the indexer immediately before submitting a transaction, the timing correlation reveals which contract state they are acting on), or transaction structure analysis (the number of segments in a transaction could reveal which circuit was called).

Privacy on Midnight is genuine at the cryptographic level. It is unexamined at the implementation level. This is not a criticism unique to Midnight -- it applies to every privacy-preserving system in production. But it is worth noting that the same project that provides the most rigorous compile-time privacy guarantees (disclosure analysis) has the least documented runtime privacy analysis.

One accidental privacy benefit: the fixed cost of proof generation -- dominated by the PLONK proving step -- provides natural timing padding. Whether the witness contains a trivial secret or a complex multi-step computation, the proof generation time is approximately the same. An observer measuring transaction timing cannot easily distinguish between different witness computations. The padding is natural but not designed. A dedicated attacker measuring sub-second timing variations in the witness computation phase (which occurs before proof generation) might still extract information. But the 18-second proving step provides a large, fixed-duration buffer that dominates the total transaction time.

The developer guide's demonstration of the private voting dApp provides a concrete end-to-end example. The off-chain witness construction computes Poseidon hashes using the same `persistentHash` function available in both the Compact circuit and the JavaScript SDK. The voter provides their secret key, vote choice, Merkle sibling hash, and direction flag as witnesses. The circuit reconstructs the Merkle root from these witnesses and asserts it matches the on-chain root. The circuit also computes a nullifier -- `persistentHash([pad(32, "nullf:"), secret_key])` -- using domain separation so that the nullifier hash and the voter's attestation hash are cryptographically unlinkable. The nullifier is disclosed (it must appear on-chain to prevent double-voting), but it cannot be traced back to the voter's identity.

What the on-chain verifier sees per vote: a nullifier hash and updated vote tallies. What the verifier does not see: which voter, their exact identity, or which Merkle leaf they occupy. The privacy boundary is sharp, and it is enforced at every level: by the compiler (disclosure analysis), by the ZKIR checker (transcript integrity), and by the cryptographic construction (domain-separated hashing).

## The Witness as a Multi-Dimensional Problem

The research literature reveals that the "Witness Gap" is not a single bottleneck but a convergence of four distinct challenges, each requiring different solutions.

**The Performance Gap.** Witness generation has been neglected relative to MSM and NTT optimization because it does not parallelize in the same way. ZKPOG shows that GPU-accelerated witness generation is possible (3-10x speedups) but requires analyzing the circuit's dependency graph and topologically sorting gates to identify independent clusters. The parallelism exists, but extracting it is harder than parallelizing polynomial arithmetic.

**The Memory Gap.** The full witness for a large computation can require hundreds of gigabytes of RAM. Streaming witness generation -- never materializing the full witness, instead generating chunks on the fly and consuming them immediately -- is the path forward. Nair, Thaler, and Zhu showed this can be achieved with $O(\sqrt{T})$ space and less than 2x time overhead, using checkpoints at regular intervals for parallel regeneration.

**The Security Gap.** The witness is the most sensitive artifact in the system. It contains the private inputs. Side-channel attacks can leak witness information through timing (R=0.57 in Zcash), cache patterns (Mukherjee et al. 2024), and network metadata. Constant-time implementation is a security requirement, not a performance optimization.

**The Correctness Gap.** The witness generator and the constraint system must compute identical functions. When they disagree, the result is a soundness bug. Static analysis tools like ZKAP (F1 score 0.82, 34 previously unknown vulnerabilities discovered) can detect divergence, but they currently work only on Circom. Extending them to Rust-based systems (halo2, Plonky3) remains an open problem.

These four gaps interact. Solving the performance gap (GPU acceleration) can worsen the security gap (GPU thread divergence from constant-time code reduces SIMT utilization). Solving the memory gap (streaming) changes the architecture in ways that affect the correctness gap (streaming provers must handle state differently than batch provers). There is no single fix. The witness problem is systemic.

The analogy holds: the magician's backstage is not just dark -- it is expensive, fragile, and surveilled. The recording equipment costs a fortune. The walls have cracks. And if the recording is wrong, the audience will believe a lie. Layer 3 is where the practical reality of zero-knowledge systems diverges most sharply from the elegant theory. The mathematics is beautiful. The engineering is brutal.

For the system architect, Layer 3 generates the most concrete questions in any ZK evaluation:

- What is the witness generation time for your target workload, and how does it compare to the proving time? If it exceeds 50%, your proving GPU is idle most of the time.
- What are the memory requirements? Can the witness fit in the VRAM of your target GPU, or must it be streamed from system RAM?
- Is the prover constant-time? If not, what information does the timing profile reveal about private inputs?
- Is client-side proving feasible on your users' hardware? If not, what is the trust model for delegated proving?
- How does the witness generator handle the correctness gap? Is the constraint system formally verified, statically analyzed, or tested against the witness generator?

These are not theoretical questions. They determine whether a ZK system provides the properties it claims. A system with fast proving but slow witness generation, insufficient memory, timing leaks, and unverified constraints is a system that looks good on benchmarks and fails in production.

---

The recording is made. It is expensive to produce. It is vulnerable to side channels. It is the most common site of implementation bugs.

But the witness is just a recording. It proves nothing by itself. Anyone could fabricate a recording. The question that Layer 4 must answer is: how do we turn this recording into a mathematical puzzle -- a system of polynomial equations -- such that checking the puzzle is vastly cheaper than re-doing the computation? How do we encode a million steps of execution into a form where a few random spot-checks are enough to guarantee that every step was correct?

That transformation is the subject of Layer 4: the most technically demanding layer in the stack, and the one where the magic trick metaphor will finally strain to its breaking point.
