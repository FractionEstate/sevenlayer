# Proof Systems, Recursion, and Folding

This document covers Layer 5: SNARK and STARK families, hybrid pipelines, recursion, folding, and the engineering reality of modern proving systems.

## Sealing the Certificate

The magician has performed the trick backstage. Every step of the computation has been recorded in a mathematical trace and encoded as a system of polynomial equations. But a recording that never leaves the backstage is worthless. The audience needs something it can hold in its hands, inspect, and trust -- without ever seeing the performance itself.

That something is a sealed certificate.

The certificate attests that the trick was performed correctly -- "this transaction is valid," "this person is over 18," "this block was executed correctly." It is small enough to carry in your pocket. It is unforgeable. Anyone can verify it. Nobody needs to see the original performance. And a forged certificate is not merely unlikely -- it is a mathematical impossibility, its probability shrinking exponentially as the security parameter grows.

Think of it this way. In the previous two chapters, we watched the computation get written down (the language), performed backstage (the witness), and translated into a mathematical puzzle (the arithmetization). Now we reach the moment the puzzle gets sealed into a certificate that will travel out into the world, to be checked by strangers who have no reason to trust us and no access to our private data. This is Layer 5: the proof system. It is the mechanism that presses the wax seal.

> Our 72 constraints over 16 witness variables are now sealed into a certificate. The prover commits to the constraint polynomials using the chosen commitment scheme (KZG, FRI, or Ajtai -- depending on the architectural path from Chapter 10). The verifier sends random challenge points (or they are derived via Fiat-Shamir from the transcript hash). The prover evaluates the committed polynomials at those points and returns the evaluations with opening proofs.
>
> The verifier checks: do the evaluations satisfy the constraint relationships at the challenged points? If yes, Schwartz-Zippel guarantees that the polynomials themselves satisfy the constraints everywhere -- except with probability at most $d/|\mathbb{F}|$, where $d$ is the polynomial degree and $|\mathbb{F}|$ is the field size. For our 4x4 Sudoku over a 256-bit field, $d$ is roughly 4 and $|\mathbb{F}|$ is roughly $2^{256}$, so the soundness error is vanishingly small.
>
> The result: a Groth16 proof of 192 bytes, or a STARK proof of around 50 KB, or a folded lattice commitment -- depending on the path. The verifier learns that the prover knows a valid solution. The verifier learns nothing about which numbers go where. The sixteen secret values never leave the prover's machine. The 4x4 grid that was the witness has been compressed into a handful of group elements and field evaluations -- the sealed certificate.

Here is how the seal works. The proof system commits to a set of polynomial evaluations. If the prover cheated anywhere in the computation, those evaluations will be inconsistent -- the polynomial will disagree with itself at a random point the verifier picks. The probability that the prover can guess which point the verifier will pick, and cheat in exactly the right way to pass that specific check, is negligible -- meaning it shrinks exponentially as the security parameter grows.

A forged certificate does not look like a convincing imitation that might fool someone. It looks like an impossible object. The proof system is designed so that forged certificates simply cannot be produced in polynomial time, assuming the underlying mathematical hardness assumptions hold. This chapter explains how the sealing mechanism works, how it evolved from a single method into a family of techniques with radically different properties, and why the engineering choices within Layer 5 are changing the entire economics of blockchain computation.

## The Three Families

Every zero-knowledge proof system in production today belongs to one of three families. They differ in what they require before you start, how large a proof they produce, and what mathematical assumptions keep them secure. Choosing among them is not a philosophical exercise. It is an engineering decision with direct consequences for cost, speed, security, and quantum resistance.

### Groth16: The Gold Standard for Size

In 2016, Jens Groth published a proof system that produces the smallest possible proofs: three elliptic curve group elements, totaling 192 bytes (two G1 points and one G2 point on BLS12-381). Verification requires three pairing computations (the Ethereum EVM implementation batches this as four pairings via EIP-1108) -- about 250,000 gas on Ethereum. Nearly a decade later, nothing comes close to this combination of proof size and verification cost. Groth16 remains the final wrapping target for almost every production ZK system that posts proofs on-chain.

The catch is severe. Groth16 requires a per-circuit trusted setup ceremony. You cannot change the circuit without re-running the ceremony. The ceremony produces a structured reference string (SRS) that contains "toxic waste" -- secret randomness that, if any single participant retains, would allow them to forge proofs for that circuit forever. The 1-of-N trust model (discussed in Chapter 2) mitigates this, but the ceremony is expensive, inflexible, and not quantum-resistant.

Put differently: Groth16 seals the smallest possible certificate -- just 192 bytes, three elliptic curve points. But you need a custom seal for every circuit you want to prove, and manufacturing that seal requires a ceremony involving thousands of people, any one of whom could secretly keep a master key to forge future certificates. If a quantum computer ever appears, every seal ever manufactured becomes useless.

Despite these limitations, Groth16's on-chain economics are so favorable that it persists as the outer shell of nearly every hybrid proving pipeline. The inner proof system might be a STARK, a folding scheme, or something else entirely. But the last step -- the proof that actually touches the blockchain -- is almost always Groth16 over the BN254 curve, because Ethereum's EVM has precompiled contracts that make BN254 pairings cheap.

### PLONK: The Universal Workhorse

In 2019, Gabizon, Williamson, and Ciobotaru published PLONK, which solved Groth16's biggest practical problem: the per-circuit setup. PLONK uses a universal structured reference string. Run one ceremony, and you can use the resulting SRS for any circuit up to a fixed size. Change your program? No new ceremony needed. Just compile a new circuit against the same SRS.

PLONK introduced "PLONKish" arithmetization -- a system of gate constraints and copy constraints glued together by a permutation argument. This turned out to be very flexible. Custom gates allow specialized operations (elliptic curve arithmetic, hash functions, range checks) to be encoded efficiently. Lookup tables (via Plookup and its successors) let the prover reference pre-computed values instead of re-deriving them from scratch. The result was a proof system that could be tuned for specific workloads while retaining universality.

Halo 2, developed by the Electric Coin Company for Zcash and later adopted by other projects, extended PLONK with custom gates, lookup tables, and a flexible backend that supports multiple commitment schemes. Note: the original Halo paper (2019) used IPA commitments with no trusted setup. Halo 2, as deployed by Zcash for Orchard and adopted by Midnight, uses KZG commitments requiring a ceremony -- a different trust model despite the shared name. When instantiated with IPA instead of KZG, Halo 2 eliminates the trusted setup entirely, and the proof size grows from constant to logarithmic, but verification becomes somewhat more expensive.

PLONK and its variants (UltraPlonk, TurboPlonk, Halo 2) are the workhorses of production ZK today. They sit at the center of a design space between Groth16's extreme compactness and STARKs' extreme transparency. Most ZK applications that need flexibility -- circuits that change frequently, applications where a per-circuit ceremony is impractical -- choose a PLONK-family system.

### STARKs: The Transparent Path

STARKs (Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge), introduced by Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, and Riabzev in 2018, took a radically different approach. No trusted setup at all. No pairings. No elliptic curves. The only cryptographic assumption is the existence of collision-resistant hash functions -- a primitive that is believed to be quantum-resistant.

The core idea is clean. STARKs prove statements about Algebraic Intermediate Representations (AIR): polynomial constraints on an execution trace, where each row represents one time step and the constraints enforce that consecutive rows are consistent. The key mechanism is the FRI protocol (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof), which verifies that a committed function is close to a low-degree polynomial. If the computation was performed correctly, the trace satisfies all constraints, and the polynomial is low-degree. If the prover cheated, the polynomial's degree blows up, and FRI catches the inconsistency with overwhelming probability.

The cost of this transparency is proof size. A STARK proof is hundreds of kilobytes -- roughly 1,000 times larger than a Groth16 proof. On Ethereum, where every byte costs gas, this difference translates directly into money. But STARKs offer something the other families cannot: a path to post-quantum security, and a proving architecture that scales almost linearly with computation size.

So the three families seal certificates with different properties. Groth16 seals the smallest possible certificate -- just 192 bytes -- but requires a custom seal for every circuit. PLONK seals a slightly larger certificate but can use the same seal for any trick, eliminating the per-circuit ceremony. STARKs seal certificates without any secret ingredient at all -- no ceremony, no toxic waste, no trust assumptions beyond collision-resistant hashing -- but the certificates are much bulkier: hundreds of kilobytes instead of hundreds of bytes.

### Three Envelopes: An Intuition

The technical differences between the three families are real, but their *character* is better grasped through analogy. Each family seals a certificate. Think of each certificate as a letter placed inside an envelope. The families differ not in what the letter says but in how the envelope is made, what it costs, and what it reveals about the process of sealing.

**Groth16 is the smallest possible envelope.** Three numbers -- two points on a curve and one more -- encode an entire computation. Consider the compression ratio. A circuit proving that an Ethereum block was executed correctly might involve billions of constraints, millions of intermediate values, a witness consuming gigabytes of memory. The Groth16 proof of that computation is 192 bytes. Three elliptic curve elements. It is as though someone handed you a novel -- a thick, sprawling saga with hundreds of characters and interlocking subplots -- and you compressed it into a haiku. Seventeen syllables. And yet a reader who knows the rules of haiku composition can verify that those seventeen syllables faithfully capture the plot. Not a summary. Not an approximation. A mathematically exact encoding from which any deviation would be detectable. The haiku either satisfies the verification equation or it does not. There is no room for a "pretty good" forgery.

The cost of this extreme compression is inflexibility. The haiku form must be custom-designed for each novel. You cannot take a haiku mold built for *War and Peace* and use it to compress *Moby Dick*. In Groth16 terms, this means a new trusted setup ceremony for every circuit. The ceremony produces the specific algebraic structure -- the structured reference string -- that makes the compression possible for that particular computation. Change the computation, and you need a new ceremony. This is why Groth16 is almost never used as the primary proof system. It is used as the *final wrapper* -- the outermost envelope -- because you only need one ceremony for the wrapping circuit, and that circuit does not change.

**PLONK is the universal envelope.** One envelope fits all letters. The envelope factory runs a single setup ceremony and produces a structured reference string that works for any circuit up to a certain size. Write a new smart contract? Same envelope. Update your program logic? Same envelope. The setup cost is paid once. After that, any computation that fits within the size bound can be sealed without a new ceremony.

The analogy is a standardized shipping container. Before containerization, every type of cargo required its own packaging, its own crane, its own dockworker expertise. A container does not care whether it holds televisions, bananas, or machine parts. It is a universal interface between the thing being shipped and the infrastructure that moves it. PLONK's universal SRS is the container. The circuit -- whatever it computes -- is the cargo. The infrastructure -- the verifier, the blockchain, the precompiled contract -- handles every circuit the same way, because they all arrive in the same container.

The proofs are slightly larger than Groth16's (a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes, depending on the variant), and verification is slightly more expensive. These are the costs of universality. You pay a modest premium for the ability to change your message without manufacturing a new envelope. For most applications, this tradeoff is overwhelmingly favorable, which is why PLONK-family systems are the workhorses of production ZK.

**STARKs are glass envelopes.** Nothing is hidden in the construction. There is no trusted setup, no toxic waste, no secret randomness that could compromise the system if leaked. The envelope-making process is entirely public. Anyone can inspect it, audit it, reproduce it. The cryptographic assumption is minimal: collision-resistant hash functions exist. That is all.

The trade: glass envelopes are bulkier than paper ones. A STARK proof is hundreds of kilobytes -- roughly a thousand times larger than a Groth16 proof. On a blockchain where every byte costs gas, this bulk translates directly into dollars. Glass is heavier than paper. You pay more to ship it. But glass has a property that paper lacks: you can see through it. The transparency is not a metaphor. It is a literal statement about the trust model. There is no ceremony to trust, no participant to worry about, no toxic waste to dispose of. The security rests on the hardest-to-break foundation in cryptography: the belief that hash functions do not have secret backdoors.

And glass has another property that matters more each year: it does not shatter under quantum impact. Hash-based cryptography is believed to resist quantum attacks. Paper envelopes -- those built on elliptic curve assumptions -- will dissolve the moment a sufficiently powerful quantum computer runs Shor's algorithm. Glass envelopes will still be standing. The bulk that seems like a disadvantage today may prove to be the price of survival.

But notice: the three envelope types are not competing products on a shelf. They are components in a supply chain. The glass envelope (STARK) is manufactured first, because it is transparent and quantum-resistant. Then the contents are transferred into a paper envelope (Groth16) for shipping, because paper is lighter and the postal system (the blockchain) charges by weight. The glass envelope never reaches the destination. It does its job backstage -- proving the computation with full transparency -- and then the result is repackaged into the smallest, cheapest container for the final mile. Understanding this supply chain is what the next section is about.

## The Hybrid Pipeline

Here is the secret that the field's own marketing has obscured: in production, the three families are not competitors. They are components of a single pipeline.

The dominant architecture in 2025 looks like this:

1. **Prove the computation with a STARK.** The inner proof system generates a large, transparent proof using fast, small-field arithmetic. No trusted setup is required. The prover runs on GPUs.

2. **Recursively compress the STARK.** Apply one or more rounds of recursive STARK verification to shrink the proof from hundreds of kilobytes to tens of kilobytes.

3. **Wrap the compressed STARK in a Groth16 SNARK.** A small circuit verifies the STARK proof and produces a Groth16 proof: 192 bytes, 250K gas to verify on-chain. The wrapping circuit adapts the STARK's field arithmetic (say, Mersenne-31) to the BN254 field that Ethereum's precompiles support.

4. **Post the SNARK on-chain.** The Ethereum verifier contract checks the Groth16 proof. It has no idea that the inner computation used a STARK. From the chain's perspective, everything looks the same.

Every major production system follows this architecture: SP1 (Succinct Labs), Stwo (StarkWare), Polygon, ZKM, and most others. The STARK generates the raw material; the SNARK seals it into a certificate the blockchain will accept. The STARK provides transparency and prover efficiency. The SNARK provides on-chain cost efficiency. Each family contributes what it does best.

The implication is worth spelling out. The "SNARK vs. STARK" debate that dominated conference panels from 2019 to 2023 was a false dichotomy. The field converged on "STARK inside, SNARK outside" because the engineering tradeoffs demanded it. Transparency for the prover. Compactness for the chain. The only remaining question is whether the outer SNARK wrapper can itself become post-quantum -- a problem that lattice-based proof systems (discussed later in this chapter) are beginning to address.

### A Concrete Pipeline: From 1,000 Transactions to a 192-Byte Proof

The hybrid architecture becomes vivid when you trace a specific workload through it, step by step. Consider a ZK rollup operator -- running on Ethereum mainnet -- who receives a batch of 1,000 transactions. Each transaction is a token transfer, a swap, or a contract call. The operator must prove that executing all 1,000 transactions against the current state produces the claimed new state root. Here is how the pipeline processes that batch in 2025.

**Step 1: Execute and generate the witness.** The operator's sequencer replays all 1,000 transactions against a local copy of the rollup's state. Every storage read, every storage write, every arithmetic operation is recorded in an execution trace -- the giant spreadsheet from Chapter 4. The witness includes all private data: account balances, nonces, intermediate computation values. This step is ordinary software execution, no cryptography involved. On a modern server, it takes 1 to 2 seconds. The output is a trace with millions of rows and dozens of columns.

**Step 2: Generate a STARK proof over a small field.** The prover takes the execution trace and produces a STARK proof using BabyBear (31-bit) or Mersenne-31 arithmetic. This is where the heavy computation happens. The trace is interpolated into polynomials, the polynomials are committed via FRI (Merkle trees of evaluations), and the FRI protocol verifies low-degree proximity. On a cluster of GPUs -- say, four NVIDIA A100s -- this step takes 3 to 5 seconds. The output is a STARK proof: transparent, hash-based, quantum-resistant, and roughly 200 to 400 kilobytes in size.

**Step 3: Recursively compress the STARK.** The raw STARK proof is too large to post on-chain economically. So the operator generates a second STARK proof that verifies the first one. This is recursion: a proof about a proof. The verifier circuit for a STARK is much smaller than the original computation circuit, so the recursive proof is faster to generate and produces a smaller output. One or two rounds of recursive compression shrink the proof from hundreds of kilobytes to tens of kilobytes. This step takes 1 to 2 seconds.

**Step 4: Wrap in Groth16 over BN254.** The compressed STARK proof is now small enough to verify inside a Groth16 circuit. A specialized wrapping circuit takes the STARK verifier computation -- check the Merkle paths, verify the FRI folding, confirm the constraint evaluations -- and expresses it as an R1CS instance over the BN254 field. The Groth16 prover then seals this into a 192-byte proof: two G1 points and one G2 point. This is the field-crossing step, where 31-bit STARK arithmetic is translated into 254-bit BN254 arithmetic. It is computationally expensive per field operation, but the circuit is small (it is only verifying a STARK, not re-executing the original computation). On a single GPU, this step takes 5 to 10 seconds.

**Step 5: Post the proof to Ethereum.** The operator submits a transaction to the rollup's on-chain verifier contract. The transaction contains the 192-byte Groth16 proof, the new state root, and a commitment to the batch of transactions. The Ethereum verifier contract calls the BN254 pairing precompile (EIP-1108), checks the three pairings, and accepts or rejects. Verification costs approximately 250,000 gas -- roughly $0.50 to $1.00 at typical gas prices. The state root is updated. The 1,000 transactions are finalized.

The audience sees only Step 5. A 192-byte proof appears on-chain. A smart contract checks it in a few milliseconds. The state updates. Nobody knows -- or needs to know -- that behind those 192 bytes lie four NVIDIA GPUs, two rounds of recursive compression, a field-crossing circuit, and the execution traces of 1,000 individual transactions. The entire pipeline, from receiving the batch to posting the proof, completes in under 15 seconds and costs under $1.00.

That is the hybrid pipeline in concrete terms. The STARK did the heavy lifting: proving the computation with transparency and quantum resistance. The Groth16 wrapper did the packaging: compressing everything into the smallest possible on-chain footprint. Each proof system contributed what it does best. The audience -- Ethereum's verifier contract -- received the finished product and asked no questions about the manufacturing process.

Two years earlier, the same pipeline took minutes and cost tens of dollars. Two years before that, it was a research prototype that could not process a full Ethereum block at all. The economics shifted not because anyone invented a fundamentally new proof system, but because each component in the pipeline got faster -- small-field arithmetic, GPU parallelism, recursive compression, optimized wrapping circuits -- and the improvements compounded multiplicatively across stages. A 3x improvement in STARK proving, combined with a 2x improvement in recursive compression, combined with a 2x improvement in Groth16 wrapping, produces a 12x improvement end-to-end. This is why the cost curve has been steeper than Moore's Law.

## Recursion vs. Folding: Russian Dolls and Snowballs

Within any proof system architecture, there is a second design choice that matters just as much: how do you handle computation that happens in steps?

A blockchain processes blocks sequentially. A zkVM executes instructions one at a time. A rollup batches transactions and proves them in order. In every case, the prover needs to demonstrate not just "this single step is correct" but "every step from the beginning until now was correct." This is Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC), first formalized by Valiant in 2008, and it sits at the heart of how proof systems scale.

### Recursion: The Russian Doll

The first approach to IVC was recursive composition. The idea is deceptively simple: to prove that steps 1 through N are all correct, you prove step N is correct *and* that you have a valid proof that steps 1 through N-1 are correct. The verifier for steps 1 through N-1 is itself expressed as a circuit, and the proof for step N includes a verification of the previous proof.

Think of Russian nesting dolls. Each doll contains a smaller doll inside it, and that smaller doll contains an even smaller one. Opening the outermost doll and confirming it contains a properly formed inner doll gives you confidence in the entire chain. You never need to open all the dolls at once.

The problem is cost. The SNARK verifier is a complex circuit -- for pairing-based systems like Groth16, it involves millions of gates. Embedding a Groth16 verifier inside a Groth16 circuit means every step of computation must pay the cost of a full SNARK verification on top of the actual computation. Zexe (Bowe, Chiesa, Green, Miers, Mishra, Wu, 2018) demonstrated this approach using depth-2 recursion over a 2-chain of pairing-friendly curves, achieving constant-size 968-byte transactions regardless of offline computation. But the proving cost per step was enormous.

### Folding: The Snowball

In 2022, Abhiram Kothapalli, Srinath Setty, and Ioanna Tzialla published Nova, and the field changed direction overnight.

Nova introduced a fundamentally different approach: instead of proving each step and recursively verifying previous proofs, you *fold* two claims into one. Here is the intuition. In recursion, each step generates a complete proof, and the next step verifies it. In folding, each step generates a *claim* -- an incomplete, unverified assertion -- and combines it with the running claim from all previous steps. The combination is a random linear combination: the prover takes the two claims, the verifier picks a random challenge, and the prover produces a single new claim that is valid if and only if both original claims were valid. No full proof is ever generated during the accumulation phase. The certificate is not sealed along the way. Claims accumulate, and the expensive seal is deferred to the very end. Only when all steps have been folded together does the prover generate a single SNARK proof for the final accumulated claim.

The snowball analogy captures it precisely. Each new step is a handful of snow. Instead of building a separate snowman for each step (recursion), you pack the new snow onto the growing snowball (folding). The snowball gets slightly larger with each step, but you never have to build an entire snowman until the very end.

Nova's key technical insight was *relaxed R1CS*. This is where the mathematics earns its keep, and it is worth understanding why.

Standard R1CS says $Az \circ Bz = Cz$ (where $A$, $B$, $C$ are matrices and $z$ is the witness vector). Now suppose you try to combine two standard R1CS instances by taking a random linear combination: $(A(z_1 + r \cdot z_2)) \circ (B(z_1 + r \cdot z_2))$. When you expand this product, cross-terms appear -- terms involving both $z_1$ and $z_2$ multiplied together -- that do not fit the $Az \circ Bz = Cz$ format. The product of two linear combinations is quadratic, but R1CS demands bilinear structure. The cross-terms break the format.

This is the kind of obstacle that looks fatal until someone sees through it. Nova's insight was to relax the constraint. Instead of requiring $Az \circ Bz = Cz$ exactly, allow $Az \circ Bz = u \cdot Cz + E$, where $u$ is a scalar and $E$ is an error vector. When $u = 1$ and $E = 0$, you recover standard R1CS. But the relaxed form is closed under random linear combination: when you combine two relaxed instances, the cross-terms that would have destroyed the standard format are absorbed into the error vector E. The format survives. The scalar $u$ tracks the linear combination's coefficient, and $E$ accumulates the algebraic debris that would otherwise break the structure.

The folding verifier is tiny -- one scalar multiplication plus hashing, roughly 10,000 multiplication gates -- compared to millions for a full SNARK verifier. This is the breakthrough: fold cheaply at every step, prove expensively only once at the end. The per-step overhead of IVC dropped by orders of magnitude.

### The Snowball Does Not Fall Apart

The natural worry about the snowball analogy is: snowballs fall apart. What is the failure mode of folding?

The answer involves a subtlety that trips up even experienced cryptographers. Folding does not provide soundness on its own. It provides a *reduction*: if the folded claim is valid, then both original claims were valid (with overwhelming probability over the verifier's random challenge). But "valid" here means "satisfies the relaxed constraint system." The final proof -- the "decider" SNARK at the end of the chain -- is what provides soundness. If the underlying commitment scheme is binding and the random challenges are honestly generated, then a cheating prover cannot produce a valid folded claim for an invalid computation. The security proof works backward: a valid final claim implies all intermediate claims were valid, which implies all computation steps were correct.

The practical penalty comes from the size of the accumulated instance. In classical Nova, the error vector E grows with each folding step. The 10,000-gate figure for Nova's folding verifier is specifically the cost of the non-native scalar multiplication required when working over a 2-cycle of curves. CycleFold (Kothapalli and Setty, 2023) delegated this scalar multiplication to a co-processor circuit on the secondary curve, where it can be computed natively in approximately 1,500 gates. The folding verifier itself -- the hash and the random linear combination -- is much cheaper. But the fundamental architecture remains: fold cheaply, prove expensively but only once, at the end.

## The Folding Genealogy

Folding is not a single technique. It is a research program that has produced a lineage of increasingly general schemes over the past four years. Understanding this lineage matters for seeing where proof systems are headed -- including the post-quantum frontier.

Before tracing each step, here is the map. Read it the way a naturalist reads a field guide: not to memorize every species, but to understand the territory they occupy. The folding genealogy advances along four independent axes:

- **Constraint generality:** R1CS (Nova) to CCS (HyperNova), covering all major arithmetizations.
- **Instance generality:** Single-instance (Nova) to multi-instance (ProtoGalaxy), enabling parallel proving.
- **Instruction generality:** Uniform IVC (Nova) to non-uniform IVC (SuperNova, SuperNeo), enabling VM execution.
- **Cryptographic generality:** Elliptic curves (Nova through CycleFold) to lattices (LatticeFold, Neo, Symphony), enabling post-quantum security.

Every scheme in the genealogy that follows advances along at least one of these axes. The reader can track the progress by asking a single question of each paper: which axis did it push forward?

### Nova (2022): The Origin

Kothapalli, Setty, and Tzialla. Folding for R1CS. The verifier performs one scalar multiplication plus hashing -- roughly 10,000 R1CS gates of recursive overhead. Prover cost is linear in the circuit size. This is the paper that made folding practical. Every subsequent folding scheme either extends, generalizes, or adapts Nova's core ideas.

### SuperNova (2022): Non-Uniform IVC

Kothapalli and Setty. Extended Nova to support multiple circuit types. Instead of one step function that repeats, SuperNova allows different step functions at each step -- exactly what you need for a virtual machine, where each instruction has a different circuit. The scheme maintains one running instance per instruction type and pays only for the circuit of the instruction actually executed. This is the "pay-per-instruction" property that makes folding-based zkVMs viable.

### HyperNova (2023): The Generalization Point

Kothapalli and Setty again. This paper is the pivot of the entire genealogy.

HyperNova generalized folding from R1CS to CCS -- Customizable Constraint Systems -- which subsume R1CS, PLONKish, and AIR in a single framework. The key enabler was the sumcheck protocol, originally due to Lund, Fortnow, Karloff, and Nisan in 1992, one of the most elegant tools in theoretical computer science. It reduces the task of checking a sum over a large domain (say, $2^{20}$ evaluations of a multilinear polynomial) to checking a single evaluation at a random point. The verifier sends random challenges in each round; the prover responds with univariate polynomials. After $\log(n)$ rounds, the verifier has a single-point claim that can be checked directly.

HyperNova uses sumcheck to fold CCS instances without degree blowup. A CCS constraint has the form: sum of products of matrix-vector multiplications equals zero. This is inherently higher-degree than R1CS. Without sumcheck, folding such constraints would require the verifier to handle cross-terms whose degree grows with the constraint degree. Sumcheck reduces the multilinear CCS equation to a single-point evaluation, allowing the folded instance to retain its structure. The verifier cost remains $O(\log m)$ field operations plus one scalar multiplication -- essentially the same as Nova, despite handling a strictly more general constraint system.

HyperNova is the generalization point because everything after it works in the CCS framework. If Nova gave folding a body, HyperNova gave it a universal language. CCS is to constraint systems what SQL is to databases: a common tongue that lets you express any query regardless of the underlying storage engine.

### ProtoStar and ProtoGalaxy (2023): Alternative Paths

These two schemes took different approaches to generalizing folding. ProtoStar (Bunz and Chen, ePrint 2023/620) built a generic accumulation framework for any interactive argument satisfying "special soundness" -- a more abstract starting point than HyperNova's CCS-specific approach. ProtoGalaxy (Eagen and Gabizon) introduced multi-instance folding: folding k instances simultaneously in a single round, rather than folding pairs sequentially. This enables high-arity proof-carrying data trees, which are needed for parallel proof generation.

Both contributed important ideas to the field, but the main trunk of the genealogy runs through HyperNova because CCS became the dominant constraint language.

### CycleFold (2023): The Practical Fix

Kothapalli and Setty. This is the engineering paper that made all the theoretical folding schemes practical over elliptic curves. The problem: Nova's folding verifier includes a scalar multiplication, which requires non-native field arithmetic when working over a 2-cycle of curves. CycleFold delegates this scalar multiplication to a co-processor circuit on the second curve, where it can be computed natively. This reduced the second-curve circuit from roughly 10,000 gates to 1,500. Not glamorous, but essential. CycleFold is the standard technique used in every practical implementation of Nova and HyperNova.

### LatticeFold (2024): Crossing Into Post-Quantum Territory

Boneh and Chen, published at ASIACRYPT 2025. LatticeFold was the first folding scheme based on lattice assumptions rather than elliptic curve assumptions. This matters enormously, because lattice problems (Module-SIS, Module-LWE) are believed to resist quantum attacks, while elliptic curve discrete logarithm falls to Shor's algorithm.

LatticeFold replaced elliptic curve commitments with Ajtai-style lattice commitments: $\text{Commit}(A, m, r) = A \cdot [m; r] \bmod q$, where $A$ is a public matrix, $m$ is the message, and $r$ is randomness. These commitments are linearly homomorphic -- exactly the property that folding needs to combine instances via random linear combination. But LatticeFold worked over large fields ($q \approx 2^{128}$), which made arithmetic expensive.

### Neo (2025): Small Fields and Pay-Per-Bit

Wilson Nguyen and Srinath Setty. Neo adapted HyperNova's CCS folding to lattice-based commitments over small fields -- specifically the Goldilocks field ($q = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$) with the cyclotomic ring $\mathbb{F}_q[X]/(\Phi_{81})$, where $\Phi_{81}(X) = X^{54} + X^{27} + 1$. Working over a 64-bit field instead of a 128-bit field makes arithmetic dramatically faster, particularly on GPUs where 64-bit integer operations are natively supported.

Neo introduced a property called "pay-per-bit commitments." In an Ajtai commitment, the cost of committing depends on the binary representation of the witness. Committing to a single bit costs 32 times less than committing to a 32-bit value. This means the prover can commit to a binary witness at a fraction of the cost of committing to field elements -- a property unique to the lattice setting that has no analog in elliptic curve commitments.

SuperNeo, presented within the same paper, extended Neo to non-uniform IVC (the lattice analog of SuperNova), supporting multiple instruction types for VM execution.

### Symphony (2026): Production-Grade Lattice Folding

Independently extending lattice-based folding to high-arity settings, Symphony refined the protocol for practical deployment. Key additions included optimized Number Theoretic Transforms over the cyclotomic ring for fast polynomial multiplication, a GPU-friendly architecture (lattice operations -- matrix-vector products, NTTs -- parallelize naturally), and formal bridge theorems connecting the folding scheme's knowledge soundness to the underlying Module-SIS and Module-LWE assumptions.

Symphony demonstrated that lattice-based folding can be practical, not just theoretical. With GPU acceleration, it achieves practical proving times, closing the performance gap with elliptic-curve-based systems while maintaining plausible post-quantum security.

Each step in the genealogy broadened the reach of folding without sacrificing its fundamental advantage: logarithmic verifier cost and linear prover cost per step. The entire genealogy, from Nova to Symphony, spans just three years. This rate of progress is unusual even by the standards of a fast-moving field.

## Nightstream: What a Folding Engine Looks Like From the Inside

The genealogy reads like a family tree. But a family tree does not show you the plumbing. It tells you who begat whom, not how the pipes connect, where the pressure builds, or which joints leak under load.

Nightstream is a real implementation of the lattice-folding lineage described above. Fifteen Rust crates, a Lean formal model, and a proving pipeline that turns execution traces into folded obligations over the Goldilocks field. It is a research prototype, not a production system -- its own README says so. But it is the most complete public implementation of CCS-native lattice-based folding available for study. And studying its engineering reveals something that theory papers consistently leave out: the hardest problem in a folding system is not any single algorithm. It is the alignment between all of them.

### A Pipeline, Not a Library

The spine of Nightstream is a sequence of crates, each doing one thing, each depending on the ones before it:

`neo-params` and `neo-math` fix the algebraic world -- Goldilocks field, cyclotomic ring, norm bounds. `neo-ccs` defines the constraint and evaluation relations. `neo-ajtai` provides the linear commitment backend. `neo-transcript` enforces Fiat-Shamir sequencing through Poseidon2 hashing. `neo-reductions` implements the algebraic proof kernel. `neo-memory` turns execution traces into per-step witness bundles. `neo-fold` coordinates the shard-and-session folding runtime and emits obligations.

This is Chapter 4's proof core triad -- constraint system, commitment scheme, information-theoretic protocol -- made concrete in Rust. Each crate does one thing. The system works only because every crate agrees with every other crate on field choice, ring structure, witness layout, commitment semantics, and transcript ordering. Break one agreement and the pipeline does not produce wrong proofs. It produces no proofs at all.

That is the nature of a pipeline. A library offers tools. A pipeline imposes discipline. You can use a library selectively. You must use a pipeline as designed, or not at all.

### The Shared Bus

How does an execution trace become a foldable witness?

The answer lives in `neo-memory`, and the design is a shared CPU bus. The execution trace -- every instruction, every memory access, every register state -- is laid out as a single columnar spine. Each step in the computation produces a row. The columns follow a fixed schema defined in the bus layout. Twist and Shout memory arguments, which verify that the prover's claimed memory operations are consistent, consume bus-extracted columns from the same spine rather than maintaining separate committed witnesses.

This is what the backstage recording machinery from Chapter 4 looks like when you unroll it into actual data structures. The magician's assistant is not just scribbling notes -- she is filling in a spreadsheet with a fixed schema, one row per step, and every downstream verification process reads from that same spreadsheet.

The design works because it is unified. One trace spine means one source of truth. No reconciliation between separate witness formats. No risk of the memory argument seeing a different witness than the folding runtime.

The bus architecture connects six components in a fixed data flow:

| Component | Role | Reads From | Writes To |
|-----------|------|------------|-----------|
| Execution trace | Records each computation step as a row | Program input + state | Columnar spine |
| Bus layout | Defines column schema (registers, flags, memory) | (architectural constant) | All downstream consumers |
| neo-memory | Builds per-step witness bundles | Columnar spine | Folding runtime |
| Twist memory args | Enforces memory consistency via permutation | Bus columns | Obligation streams (val lane) |
| neo-fold | Accumulates shard/session folding obligations | Per-step bundles | main + val obligation streams |
| Finalizer | Consumes both lanes and produces outer proof | main + val obligations | Final proof artifact |

The design is fragile because unified. Bus layout, witness builder, CPU constraints, and oracle expectations must all agree on the exact column semantics. If `neo-memory` produces a witness with columns in one order and `neo-fold` expects them in another, the mismatch is not caught by type checking. It is caught by a constraint that fails to satisfy, deep in the pipeline, with an error message that does not point back to the layout disagreement. This is the kind of bug that theory papers never discuss, because in theory, witness layout is not a concept. In engineering, it is the concept.

### Three Reductions and Two Lanes

The algebraic heart of Nightstream lives in `neo-reductions`, which implements three reductions:

**Pi_CCS** reduces CCS constraint satisfaction into evaluation claims. This is the step that transforms "does this witness satisfy these constraints?" into "does this polynomial evaluate correctly at this random point?" -- the same transition from constraint checking to evaluation checking that appears throughout modern proof systems.

**Pi_RLC** performs random linear combination, batching multiple evaluation claims into one. This is where the folding happens: two claims become one, weighted by a verifier challenge.

**Pi_DEC** handles decomposition, ensuring that the committed witness values stay within the norm bounds required by the lattice commitment scheme. Without this, the prover could fold claims using witness values that violate the short-vector assumptions that make Ajtai commitments binding.

The reductions crate preserves a three-path architecture that deserves attention. `Optimized` is the fast runtime path. `PaperExact` mirrors the published protocol specification step for step, sacrificing performance for auditability. `OptimizedWithCrosscheck` runs both paths and compares their outputs. This is not paranoia. It is engineering discipline. The optimized path inevitably diverges from the paper's notation, and a reference implementation that can be run in parallel provides a semantic anchor.

After the reductions, the folding runtime in `neo-fold` introduces the two-lane obligation model. The `main` lane carries the primary folded claims. The `val` lane carries a separate obligation stream for the Twist-related verification path, derived from a distinct random challenge. These are not interchangeable. Verification reconstructs obligations in both lanes, but verification alone does not finish the proof. Completion depends on a finalizer that consumes both lanes and produces the outer proof. The system emits a structured proof state, not a finished certificate.

What does a two-lane divergence look like in practice? Suppose the prover, at folding step 3, manipulates a register value in the witness -- setting $r_7$ to 42 instead of the correct value 37. The `main` lane, using random challenge $\alpha$, accumulates an obligation that combines this register with others: $\alpha \cdot r_1 + \alpha^2 \cdot r_2 + \cdots + \alpha^7 \cdot r_7 + \cdots$ The wrong value shifts the accumulated sum, but with a single challenge, the prover might get lucky -- if $\alpha$ happens to land on a root of the error polynomial, the corruption is invisible.

The `val` lane exists to prevent this. It uses an independent challenge $\beta$, drawn from a different Fiat-Shamir transcript fork. The probability that the same error is invisible under *both* $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is at most $d/|K|^2$, where $d$ is the constraint degree and $|K|$ is the extension field size. For Neo's parameters ($K = \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $q \sim 2^{64}$), this probability is less than $2^{-127}$. The two lanes provide soundness amplification: an error that survives one random challenge is vanishingly unlikely to survive both. The finalizer checks that both lanes produce consistent results -- and if the manipulated $r_7$ corrupted the `main` lane's obligation, the `val` lane catches the inconsistency and the proof fails.

### The Lean Boundary

Nightstream includes a formal subproject in Lean 4 that closes theorem surfaces for the core protocol. The Lean model covers the algebraic reductions, the commitment binding properties under Module-SIS, and the soundness chain from folded claims back to original computation steps.

This is unusual for a research prototype. Most implementations at this stage rely entirely on paper proofs and test suites. Nightstream's formal model provides a higher standard of assurance for the mathematical core.

But there is a boundary that formal methods cannot cross on their own. The Lean proofs verify that the *mathematics* is correct -- that the reductions preserve soundness, that the commitment scheme is binding under stated assumptions. The Rust runtime must then consume those Lean-closed theorem surfaces exactly as intended. The proofs live in one world; the code lives in another. The residual risk is not that the theorems are wrong. It is that the code, through a layout mismatch, an off-by-one index, or a misread parameter, might inhabit a slightly different mathematical world than the one the theorems describe. Mathematics proven correct in the abstract; the question is whether the implementation faithfully instantiates it. This is a higher-quality problem than most systems have. It is still the real remaining assurance boundary.

To be concrete about what Lean proves and what it does not: the Lean formalization verifies that the mathematical reductions are sound -- that if the folded claim passes the verifier's checks, then the original CCS instance was satisfiable. It proves the *if-then* chain from folded proof to original computation. What Lean does *not* prove is that the Rust code in `neo-fold` correctly instantiates the reduction. An off-by-one index in a matrix multiplication, a transposed loop bound in the commitment computation, a misread parameter from `neo-params` -- any of these could cause the Rust implementation to inhabit a slightly different mathematical world than the one Lean verified. The residual risk is implementation fidelity, not mathematical unsoundness. SP1's approach -- formal verification of opcode constraints against the RISC-V Sail specification -- attacks the same gap from the opposite direction: proving the code matches the spec rather than proving the spec is sound. Neither project has closed the full loop from spec to code to hardware. That loop is the frontier.

### Unfinished Scaffolding

The core proving runtime -- reductions, memory, folding -- is maintained and tested. The rest of the system is at varying stages of completion.

The finalizer that consumes both obligation lanes and produces an outer proof is work in progress. `neo-spartan-bridge`, which would compress the folded obligations into a Spartan-style SNARK, is explicitly experimental. `neo-midnight-bridge`, which would connect Nightstream's output to Midnight's PLONK/KZG verification layer, exists as a roadmap interoperability path rather than a maintained product surface.

The project's README describes it as a research prototype. This is honest, and the honesty matters. A system that accurately describes its own incompleteness is more trustworthy than one that claims a completeness it has not achieved. The core is real. The edges are still under construction. That distinction should be preserved in any evaluation of the system.

### What the Plumbing Reveals

The main lesson from Nightstream is not about any single cryptographic primitive. It is about alignment.

The hardest engineering in a modern folding system is not inventing a new commitment scheme or designing a new reduction. It is making the witness layout match the fold expectations. Making the reductions agree with the commitment semantics. Making the transcript bind every public input before challenges are sampled. Making the bus columns line up between the builder that writes them and the constraints that read them.

After 2023, the interesting work in proof systems moved from individual algorithmic breakthroughs to pipeline coordination. Nova was a breakthrough. HyperNova was a breakthrough. But getting fifteen crates to agree on column ordering, norm bounds, transcript sequencing, and obligation semantics -- that is not a breakthrough. It is the slow, patient, unglamorous work of making a real system function. And it is where most of the time goes.

That lesson does not appear in any genealogy. It can only come from a codebase.

## Circle STARKs and Stwo: A Generational Leap

While the folding lineage was evolving, a parallel revolution was happening in the STARK world. In 2024, Haboeck (Polygon Labs), Levit, and Papini (StarkWare) published Circle STARKs, and their production implementation -- Stwo -- became the fastest proof system ever deployed.

The key insight is a change in the algebraic structure underlying the FFT, which is the computational backbone of every STARK prover. Traditional STARKs use multiplicative subgroups of finite fields for their FFT domains. These subgroups exist in large fields (like BN254's 254-bit field), but finding smooth-order subgroups in small fields is difficult. Circle STARKs replace the multiplicative subgroup with the *circle group* of a Mersenne prime field.

Why the circle group? The Mersenne-31 field ($M31 = 2^{31} - 1$) is a prime with a special property: the circle group $C(\mathbb{F}_p) = \{(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 = 1 \text{ over } \mathbb{F}_p\}$ has order $p + 1 = 2^{31}$, which is a perfect power of 2. This enables a radix-2 FFT (the Circle FFT, or CFFT) analogous to the standard Cooley-Tukey FFT but operating over circle points. Each FRI step halves the domain using the circle group's "squaring" map, and the entire protocol adapts naturally to the circle geometry.

Why does the field size matter so much? Because 31-bit numbers fit in a single 32-bit machine word. On modern CPUs with SIMD instructions, you can process 8 or 16 M31 elements in parallel per instruction. On GPUs, the advantage is even more dramatic. Arithmetic over M31 is roughly 100 times faster than arithmetic over BN254's 254-bit field. When your proof system spends most of its time doing field arithmetic, a 100x speedup in the field operations translates almost directly into a 100x speedup in proving.

The numbers confirm this. Stwo, StarkWare's production implementation of Circle STARKs, went live on Starknet mainnet in 2025. Every Starknet block is now proven by Stwo. The benchmarks:

- **940x throughput improvement** over Stone (StarkWare's previous prover)
- **50x improvement** over ethSTARK (the academic reference implementation)
- GPU acceleration via ICICLE-Stwo adds another 3.25x to 7x on top of the CPU SIMD backend
- Sub-second recursive proving is within reach: roughly 20 milliseconds for 10,000 Poseidon hash evaluations

These are not projections. This is production performance, running on mainnet, proving real blocks with real transactions. The gap between "academic proof system" and "deployed infrastructure" has closed.

### Why the Circle Group Matters

The phrase "circle group" sounds like an abstraction. It is not. It is a geometric fact about numbers that makes everything else possible, and it deserves a careful explanation.

Start with what came before. Traditional STARKs need a domain of points where they can evaluate polynomials -- a set of evenly-spaced "sampling points" that enable the FFT. In large fields like BN254, you find these points in the multiplicative group: pick a generator $g$, and the powers $g, g^2, g^3, \ldots, g^{2^k}$ form a subgroup of order $2^k$. These powers wrap around like hours on a clock face. The FFT works because the subgroup has smooth order (a power of 2), so the Cooley-Tukey butterfly decomposition applies perfectly.

But in small fields, this strategy collapses. The Mersenne-31 field has only $2^{31} - 2$ nonzero elements. Its multiplicative group has order $2^{31} - 2 = 2 \times 3 \times 357{,}913{,}941$. The largest power-of-2 subgroup has order just 2 -- it contains only {1, -1}. You cannot run an FFT of size $2^{24}$ over a group of size 2. The multiplicative group of M31 is, for FFT purposes, useless.

This is where the circle enters. Consider the set of all pairs $(x, y)$ in M31 that satisfy $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. This is the unit circle over the finite field -- not a continuous curve but a discrete set of points. The key fact: this set has exactly $p + 1 = 2^{31}$ points. Not $2^{31} - 2$. Not some awkward composite. Exactly $2^{31}$. A perfect power of 2.

The coincidence is not a coincidence. It is a theorem. For any Mersenne prime $p = 2^n - 1$, the circle group $C(\mathbb{F}_p)$ has order $p + 1 = 2^n$. This is because the circle group over $\mathbb{F}_p$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ modulo $\mathbb{F}_p^*$ -- a quotient that inherits the 2-adic structure of $p + 1$. When $p$ is a Mersenne prime, that structure is maximally smooth: a pure power of 2.

This perfect power-of-2 structure gives you the cleanest possible FFT. The Circle FFT (CFFT) decomposes a polynomial evaluation over $2^{31}$ points into layers of half-size evaluations, just as the standard Cooley-Tukey FFT does over multiplicative subgroups. Each layer halves the domain. After 31 layers, you are done. No padding, no awkward leftovers, no compromises.

### The Squaring Map: Folding a Circle in Half

The FRI protocol -- the heart of every STARK's proof of low degree -- works by repeatedly halving the evaluation domain. At each step, the prover combines pairs of evaluations into single values, reducing the domain by a factor of 2. After enough steps, the polynomial is so small that the verifier can check it directly.

In a traditional STARK over a multiplicative group, the halving map is squaring: the map $x \mapsto x^2$ sends a subgroup of order $2^k$ to a subgroup of order $2^{k-1}$. Each element and its "twin" (its negation in the group) map to the same value, so the domain folds in half.

On the circle, the halving map is also a squaring -- but a *geometric* squaring. The circle has a group law: you can "add" two points by a formula analogous to angle addition. The squaring map sends a point to its double under this group law. Concretely, for a point $(x, y)$ on the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, the doubling map sends $(x, y)$ to $(2x^2 - 1, 2xy)$. This map is 2-to-1: each image point has exactly two preimages. So the circle of $2^k$ points folds onto a circle of $2^{k-1}$ points.

The visual intuition is literal. Imagine folding a circle in half. The top half maps onto the bottom half. Each point on the bottom half corresponds to two points on the original circle -- one on top, one on bottom. The FRI protocol does exactly this, algebraically. At each step, the prover commits to evaluations on a circle, the verifier sends a random challenge, and the prover uses the challenge to combine each pair of evaluations (the point and its "fold partner") into a single value on the half-size circle. After $\log(n)$ steps, only a constant-size polynomial remains.

This geometric folding is why Circle STARKs achieve the same asymptotic efficiency as traditional STARKs -- $O(n \log n)$ prover time, $O(\log^2 n)$ verifier time, $O(\log^2 n)$ proof size -- while operating over a field where the elements are only 31 bits wide.

### Why 31-Bit Arithmetic Is So Fast

The final piece of the Circle STARK advantage is not algebraic but architectural. It concerns the physical reality of how modern processors handle numbers.

A 64-bit CPU register holds 64 bits. A 254-bit BN254 field element requires four 64-bit "limbs" and careful carry propagation between them. A single field multiplication over BN254 involves roughly 16 limb multiplications and a cascade of additions and carries -- effectively 20 to 30 machine instructions per field multiplication. This is multi-precision arithmetic, and it is inherently serial: each carry depends on the result of the previous limb multiplication.

A 31-bit M31 field element fits in a single 32-bit word. A single field multiplication is one 32-bit multiply followed by one modular reduction -- and because $M31 = 2^{31} - 1$ is a Mersenne prime, the reduction is a single addition and a conditional subtraction. Two machine instructions. The ratio is severe: 2 instructions for M31 versus 20-30 for BN254. A factor of 10 to 15, per operation.

But the advantage compounds under parallelism. A 64-bit register can hold two M31 elements side by side. An AVX-256 SIMD register holds eight. An AVX-512 register holds sixteen. A single SIMD instruction can multiply sixteen M31 elements simultaneously, producing sixteen field products in the time it takes to perform one BN254 multiplication. The theoretical throughput ratio is not 10x. It is 100x or more.

On a GPU, the effect is even more dramatic. A GPU's streaming multiprocessors are optimized for 32-bit integer and floating-point operations -- the native word size of graphics workloads. M31 arithmetic maps directly onto the hardware's sweet spot. BN254 arithmetic requires emulation using multiple 32-bit operations per limb, with register pressure and carry chains that reduce occupancy (the fraction of the GPU's compute units that are actively working). In practice, Stwo's GPU backend -- implemented via ICICLE -- achieves 3.25x to 7x additional speedup on top of the already-fast CPU SIMD implementation. The cumulative advantage of small-field arithmetic, from instruction-level to chip-level, is why Circle STARKs proved to be not a modest improvement over traditional STARKs but a qualitative jump.

The Mersenne prime M31 is not the only small field in production. BabyBear ($p = 2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1 = 15 \times 2^{27} + 1$) offers similar 31-bit arithmetic with a multiplicative group of smooth order ($2^{27}$ divides $p - 1$), enabling traditional multiplicative-subgroup FFTs rather than circle FFTs. SP1 uses BabyBear for its inner proof system. The choice between M31 and BabyBear is a choice between circle-group FFTs and multiplicative-group FFTs -- two paths to the same destination of fast, small-field proving. Both paths converge on the same insight: the biggest optimization in proof system engineering is not a cleverer algorithm. It is a smaller number.

## Real-Time Ethereum Proving

The performance revolution in proof systems has had a direct economic consequence worth pausing to appreciate, because it changes the fundamental calculus of what this technology is good for.

In December 2023, proving a single Ethereum block cost approximately $80.21. By December 2025, the cost had fallen to roughly $0.04 -- a 2,000x reduction in 24 months. Airbender (ZKsync's prover) achieved $0.0001 per transfer. These numbers come from CastleLabs and Ethproofs benchmarks, and they represent a cost curve steeper than Moore's Law.

But cost is only half the story. Speed matters equally, because Ethereum produces a new block every 12 seconds. If proving takes longer than 12 seconds, the prover cannot keep up with the chain. For years, this was a distant goal. In late 2025, four teams crossed the threshold:

- **SP1 Hypercube** (Succinct Labs): Proved 99.7% of Ethereum Layer 1 blocks in under 12 seconds, using 16 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs (hardware cost approximately $32,000). SP1 Hypercube uses a multilinear polynomial stack built entirely on the sumcheck protocol, with a "jagged" polynomial commitment scheme that enables pay-per-use proving.

- **ZKsync Airbender**: Achieved 21.8 million cycles per second on a single H100 GPU, proving Ethereum blocks in approximately 35 seconds. Open-source, moving toward formal verification.

- **Two additional teams** from the Ethereum Foundation's proving ecosystem demonstrated sub-12-second proving under various hardware configurations.

The Ethereum Foundation responded by declaring the speed race "operationally viable" in December 2025 and shifting its targets. The new requirements: less than 10 seconds per block, less than $100,000 in hardware, less than 10 kilowatts of power, 128-bit provable security, and proof sizes under 300 kilobytes. The pivot from speed to security signals that the raw performance problem, which dominated proof system research for five years, has been substantially solved. The next frontier is formal security guarantees -- a topic we will revisit in Chapter 7.

This cost drop matters for reasons beyond Ethereum. When proving costs $80, ZK proofs are a luxury -- viable only for high-value transactions or well-funded rollups. When proving costs four cents, ZK proofs become infrastructure -- cheap enough to apply to every transaction, every block, every state transition. The technology moves from "expensive security upgrade" to "default operating mode." That shift was enabled almost entirely by improvements at Layer 5.

## The Proof Core: Why Layers 4, 5, and 6 Are Inseparable

At this point in our tour of the seven-layer stack, a structural observation is unavoidable. The boundaries between Layer 4 (arithmetization), Layer 5 (proof system), and Layer 6 (cryptographic primitives) are not clean lines. They are gradients.

Consider the design decisions involved in building a proof system:

- The **finite field** (Layer 6) determines which arithmetic is fast. Mersenne-31 enables SIMD-friendly 32-bit operations. Goldilocks enables efficient 64-bit operations on GPUs. BN254 requires expensive 254-bit multi-precision arithmetic. The field choice propagates upward through every layer.

- The **commitment scheme** (Layer 6) determines the trust model and proof size. KZG commitments (from pairings, Layer 6) give constant-size proofs but require a trusted setup. FRI commitments (from hash functions, Layer 6) give logarithmic proofs with transparency. Ajtai commitments (from lattices, Layer 6) give post-quantum security with larger proofs. The commitment scheme shapes the proof system architecture.

- The **arithmetization** (Layer 4) determines which constraints the proof system must handle. R1CS, CCS, AIR, PLONKish -- each format has different properties, and the proof system must be designed to handle the chosen format efficiently. CCS folding (HyperNova) requires the sumcheck protocol. AIR proofs (STARKs) require FRI. The arithmetization and the proof system co-evolve.

These three choices -- field, commitment, arithmetization -- form a tightly coupled triad. Change one, and the other two must adapt. This is why we call them the "proof core": they function as a single design unit, even though our seven-layer model places them in separate layers.

The layered model is still useful for understanding. It separates concerns that are conceptually distinct: what the mathematics *is* (Layer 6), how computation is *encoded* (Layer 4), and how the encoding is *verified* (Layer 5). But the reader should understand that in practice, these layers are designed together, optimized together, and constrained by each other's choices. A proof system is not assembled from independent components like bricks in a wall. It is forged as a single alloy, where the properties of each ingredient determine the properties of the whole.

## Fiat-Shamir Vulnerabilities

Every proof system we have discussed relies on a technique called the Fiat-Shamir transform to convert an interactive protocol into a non-interactive one. In the interactive version, the verifier sends random challenges to the prover. In the non-interactive version, the prover generates the challenges by hashing the protocol's transcript -- all previous messages -- into pseudorandom values. This eliminates the need for the verifier to be online during proving.

The Fiat-Shamir transform is simple in principle but treacherous in practice. The transcript that gets hashed must include *everything* that the verifier would have seen in the interactive version. If the prover omits anything -- a public input, a commitment, a previous challenge -- then the resulting hash is not a faithful simulation of the interactive protocol, and soundness can break.

### Frozen Heart and Fiat-Shamir Vulnerabilities

Why does this matter at Layer 5 specifically? Because the Fiat-Shamir transform is the *binding* mechanism between prover and verifier. In the interactive version of any proof protocol, the verifier generates fresh random challenges that force the prover to commit before seeing what will be checked. The Fiat-Shamir transform replaces these live challenges with hash-derived challenges -- but only if the hash input includes *every* public value the verifier would have seen. The transcript is the contract between the two parties. Omit a single term, and the prover can retroactively choose commitments that satisfy whatever challenges arise. The mathematical proof of soundness assumes the transcript is complete. The implementation must deliver on that assumption, term by term, or the proof of soundness is vacated.

This is not a theoretical concern. The "Frozen Heart" vulnerability class, disclosed by Trail of Bits in 2022, affected six independent implementations across three proof systems. The "Last Challenge Attack" of 2024 compromised gnark's PLONK verifier, used by multiple Ethereum rollups. In 2025, Solana's ZK ElGamal repeated the pattern. Chapter 8 catalogs these incidents in forensic detail -- what was omitted, how the forgery was constructed, and what the governance implications are for on-chain verification. Here at Layer 5, the lesson is narrower but no less urgent: the gap between a proof system's mathematical specification and its implementation is where real-world attacks live.

Fiat-Shamir vulnerabilities are the "SQL injection" of zero-knowledge cryptography: a well-understood class of bug that keeps recurring because it is easy to get wrong and hard to detect by inspection. They remind us that the security of a proof system is not just a property of its mathematical design. It is a property of its implementation, its specification, and the gap between the two. This is why formal verification of proof system implementations -- not just their mathematical specifications -- is increasingly recognized as essential. SP1 Hypercube's formal verification of all 62 RISC-V opcode constraints against the official RISC-V Sail specification represents the state of the art in this direction.

## Case Study: Midnight's Sealed Certificate

To see how these abstract proof system choices play out in a real system, consider Midnight -- the privacy-focused blockchain developed by Input Output Global (IOG) for the Cardano ecosystem. Midnight's sealed certificate tells us what Layer 5 looks like when theory meets production.

### The Proof System: Halo 2 / UltraPlonk over BLS12-381

Midnight chose a PLONK-family proof system: specifically Halo 2, an extension of UltraPlonk with custom gates and lookup tables. The curve is BLS12-381, a pairing-friendly curve with better security properties than BN254 (roughly 128-bit security vs. BN254's ~100 bits after Tower NFS advances). Although the original Halo paper (2019) used inner product arguments (IPA) that required no trusted setup, Midnight's deployment uses KZG polynomial commitments over BLS12-381, which require a Powers-of-Tau ceremony -- a universal trusted setup with a 1-of-N trust assumption.

This places Midnight firmly in the "classical SNARK" camp: pairing-based, recursion-capable, not post-quantum. It is a mature, well-understood choice. The PLONK arithmetization is flexible enough to support Midnight's privacy-preserving smart contract model, where transactions carry zero-knowledge proofs of valid state transitions.

### The Four-Phase Transaction Pipeline

Midnight's proof generation follows a four-phase pipeline that illustrates how the sealed certificate gets manufactured in practice:

**Phase 1: Circuit Execution (callTx).** The DApp calls a contract function. The Compact compiler has already compiled this function into a ZKIR (Zero-Knowledge Intermediate Representation) circuit. The circuit executes locally -- on the user's machine -- producing an "unproven transaction" that contains the execution trace but no proof.

**Phase 2: Proof Generation (proveTx).** The unproven transaction is sent to a local proof server running on localhost:6300. This is a separate process, launched via Docker, that generates the ZK proof. The witness (private inputs) never leaves the client machine. The proof server runs Halo 2's prover and returns a proven transaction. This step dominates latency. This is where the certificate gets sealed.

**Phase 3: Fee Balancing (balanceTx).** The proven transaction is bound, balanced (fee inputs are added from the user's DUST wallet), and signed. This step is sub-second.

**Phase 4: Submission (submitTx).** The finalized transaction -- containing the ZK proof and the public transcript of state reads and writes -- is submitted to the blockchain. The node verifies the proof against the on-chain verifier key, checks that the transcript is consistent with the current ledger state, and applies the state transition. The sealed certificate has reached the audience.

### The Performance Reality

Measured performance on Midnight's devnet reveals the cost of sealing in concrete terms:

| Operation | Time | Bottleneck |
|-----------|------|------------|
| Deploy (constructor circuit) | 17-27 seconds | Proof generation |
| Circuit call (simple increment) | 17-18 seconds | Proof generation |
| Circuit call (sealed bid) | 22-24 seconds | Proof generation |
| Circuit call (execute escrow) | 23.8 seconds | Proof generation |
| Balance + submit | < 1 second | Network |
| Failed assertion (local) | 0.1-0.5 seconds | No proof needed |

The pattern is clear: proof generation accounts for 95% or more of every transaction's latency. A simple counter increment (the "hello world" of smart contracts) takes 17 seconds because the Halo 2 prover must generate a full zero-knowledge proof. A more complex circuit (escrow execution) takes 24 seconds. Everything else -- fee balancing, signing, network submission, on-chain verification -- is negligible by comparison.

From the user's perspective, Layer 5 is a 17-to-28-second pause during which the proof server is pressing the seal into wax. The cryptography is working. The privacy is being maintained. But the user is waiting.

### Midnight vs. the Frontier

Midnight's architecture makes different choices than the proof systems at the performance frontier. It does not use STARKs. It does not use folding. It does not use GPU acceleration (the proof server appears to be CPU-only). It does not use small-field arithmetic. These are deliberate engineering choices that prioritize maturity and correctness over raw speed.

A comparison with Ethereum is instructive:

| Property | Midnight (Halo 2) | Neo/Symphony (Lattice folding) | SP1 Hypercube |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| Proof system family | PLONK | Folding (CCS) | STARK + sumcheck |
| Hardness assumption | Discrete log | Module-SIS/LWE | Collision-resistant hashing |
| Post-quantum | No | Yes (plausible) | Yes (inner proof) |
| Field | BLS12-381 (255-bit) | Goldilocks (64-bit) | M31/BabyBear (31-bit) |
| Composition strategy | Recursion | Folding | STARK recursion + SNARK wrap |
| Proof time (simple circuit) | 17-18 seconds | GPU-accelerated NTT | Sub-second |
| Proof size | ~hundreds of bytes | Larger (lattice-based) | ~192 bytes (after Groth16 wrap) |
| Trust model | Trusted (universal SRS) | Transparent | Transparent inner, trusted outer |

Midnight's 17-second proof time for a simple increment reflects BLS12-381's expensive 255-bit arithmetic, the absence of GPU acceleration, and the overhead of a full Halo 2 proof per transaction. SP1 Hypercube's sub-second proving reflects M31's cheap 31-bit arithmetic, GPU parallelism, and an architecture optimized for throughput. These are not different implementations of the same idea. They are different points in a design space where field size, hardware utilization, and proof architecture interact multiplicatively.

None of this is meant to criticize Midnight. Its choices are appropriate for a privacy-focused system where correctness and auditability matter more than raw speed, and where the developer toolchain (Compact language, ZKIR, local proof server) provides a coherent end-to-end experience. But it illustrates how the choices made when sealing the certificate -- amplified by the field and commitment choices at Layer 6 -- determine the user experience at the application layer.

## SNARK Recursion vs. Folding: The Full Picture

Now that we have seen both approaches in action -- Midnight's recursive Halo 2 architecture and the folding genealogy leading to Neo and Symphony -- we can draw a more complete picture of how they compare.

### When Recursion Wins

Recursive proof composition is the right choice when:

- The chain of computation is short (tens of steps, not millions)
- The proof system already has a cheap verifier circuit (as Halo 2 does for its IPA-based verification)
- The application needs per-step proofs (every transaction gets its own proof, as in Midnight)
- The infrastructure is mature and the priority is correctness over performance

Recursion is conceptually simpler: each step produces a proof, and the next step verifies it. There are no accumulated instances to manage, no decider to run at the end, and no error vectors that grow with the chain length. For short chains and mature tooling, recursion is the pragmatic choice.

### When Folding Wins

Folding is the right choice when:

- The chain of computation is long (millions of VM steps)
- Per-step cost must be minimized (the overhead of a full SNARK verification per step is unacceptable)
- The application is a zkVM or rollup that processes large batches of transactions
- Post-quantum security is a requirement (lattice-based folding via Neo/Symphony)
- Parallel proving is needed (multi-instance folding via ProtoGalaxy enables tree-structured PCD)

The asymptotic advantage of folding is clear: $O(|F|)$ prover cost per step (where $|F|$ is the step circuit size) plus roughly 1,500 gates of folding overhead (with CycleFold), compared to $O(|F| + |V|)$ for recursion, where $|V|$ is the size of the verifier circuit (potentially millions of gates). For a zkVM executing millions of RISC-V instructions, this difference is the gap between practical and impractical.

### The Convergence

In practice, the distinction between recursion and folding is blurring. Most production systems use a hybrid: folding for the inner loop (accumulate computation steps cheaply), then a monolithic SNARK (Spartan, Groth16) as the "decider" that produces the final succinct proof. Nova uses Spartan as its decider. Mangrove (Nguyen, Datta, Chen, Tyagi, Boneh, 2024) builds a k-arity PCD tree where leaf nodes fold computation chunks and internal nodes merge folded instances, with a final SNARK for the NP statement. The boundary between "folding" and "recursion" dissolves into a pipeline where both techniques serve different stages.

The key decision variable is step count. For computations under approximately 1,000 steps, recursion with a fast inner proof system (Groth16 or PLONK) is competitive in both prover time and implementation complexity -- the per-step overhead of a full recursive proof is high but amortizes over few steps. For computations exceeding 10,000 steps -- the regime of zkVMs proving full program executions -- folding's $O(|F|)$ per-step cost with ~1,500 gates of folding overhead dominates recursion's $O(|F| + |V|)$ per-step cost, where $|V|$ is the verifier circuit size. The crossover region between 1,000 and 10,000 steps depends on the specific constraint system, field size, and hardware: folding wins earlier on small fields (where $|V|$ is relatively large compared to $|F|$) and later on pairing-friendly fields (where recursive verification is cheap). In practice, the distinction is blurring -- the dominant architecture uses folding for the inner accumulation loop and a single recursive SNARK compression as the final decider step.

## The Post-Quantum Horizon

Everything we have discussed in this chapter faces an existential question: what happens when quantum computers arrive?

Shor's algorithm breaks the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time. This means every proof system built on elliptic curve cryptography -- Groth16, PLONK, Halo 2, KZG commitments, all of Nova's original elliptic-curve-based instantiations -- becomes insecure. Not "might become insecure." Becomes insecure. The mathematical fact is established; only the engineering timeline is uncertain.

The NIST IR 8547 deprecation schedule targets 2035 for phasing out pre-quantum cryptography. Conservative estimates for "Q-Day" -- the date when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer exists -- range from 2032 to 2035. For blockchain systems with 10+ year lifespans, this means systems deployed today must either plan for migration or be built on quantum-resistant foundations from the start.

The STARK family is already partially quantum-resistant: its security rests on collision-resistant hash functions, which resist quantum attacks (though Grover's algorithm reduces their effective security, SHA-256's collision resistance drops from 128 bits to roughly 85 bits under the BHT algorithm, though this attack requires quantum random-access memory, which is widely considered physically impracticable with current technology). But the STARK-to-SNARK wrapping pipeline reintroduces quantum vulnerability at the final step, because the Groth16 wrapper uses BN254 pairings.

The lattice folding branch of the genealogy -- LatticeFold, Neo, Symphony -- represents the most direct path to post-quantum proof systems. Neo achieves 127-bit security under plausible lattice hardness assumptions (Module-SIS, Module-LWE), operates over the GPU-friendly Goldilocks field, and supports the full CCS constraint framework via sumcheck-based folding. Symphony extends this to production-grade performance with GPU-optimized NTTs.

The remaining gap is on-chain verification. No post-quantum on-chain verifier exists in production. Lattice-based proofs are larger than elliptic-curve-based proofs (tens of kilobytes vs. hundreds of bytes), and no blockchain has precompiled contracts for lattice operations. Closing this gap -- either through lattice-friendly L1 verification or through novel compression techniques -- is one of the open problems at the frontier of the field.

## From Speed Race to Security Race

The story of Layer 5 over the last three years is a story of two races.

The first race was about speed. From 2022 to 2025, the question was: can you prove computation fast enough for it to matter? Can you prove an Ethereum block before the next block arrives? Can you bring the cost below a dollar, below a dime, below a penny? This race has been substantially won. Real-time proving is operational. Costs are in the single-digit cents. The hardware stack -- GPUs, SIMD, and potentially FPGAs and ASICs -- has been mobilized.

The second race is about security. The Ethereum Foundation's December 2025 announcement marked the pivot: the target shifted from "prove fast" to "prove with 128-bit provable security." This means not just believing the proof system is secure, but having a formal proof that a computationally bounded adversary cannot forge proofs with probability better than $2^{-128}$. It means formally verifying the implementation against the specification. It means accounting for the gap between the random oracle model (where Fiat-Shamir uses ideal hash functions) and reality (where Fiat-Shamir uses SHA-256 or Poseidon).

SP1 Hypercube's formal verification of all 62 RISC-V opcode constraints against the RISC-V Sail specification is a milestone in this second race. It demonstrates that production proof systems can achieve the level of formal rigor that was previously associated only with academic papers. But verifying opcodes is only the beginning. The full stack -- from the Fiat-Shamir transform through the polynomial commitment scheme through the field arithmetic -- must be verified end-to-end. This is a harder problem, and it is the one that will define Layer 5's trajectory over the next several years.

## The Sealed Certificate

Layer 5 is where the mathematics becomes a machine. The abstract polynomial constraints from Layer 4 are sealed into a tamper-evident certificate that can travel across networks, be verified by strangers, and survive adversarial scrutiny. The certificate's properties -- its size, its verification cost, its security assumptions, its quantum resistance -- are determined by the proof system that seals it.

Three families of proof systems (Groth16, PLONK, STARKs) have converged into a single hybrid pipeline where each contributes its strengths. Folding schemes evolved from Nova's R1CS-specific innovation into a family of increasingly general techniques spanning CCS, multi-instance proving, non-uniform IVC, and lattice-based post-quantum security. Circle STARKs and Stwo delivered a 940x throughput improvement through the simple insight that 31-bit field arithmetic is 100 times faster than 254-bit arithmetic. Proving costs plummeted by three orders of magnitude in two years, and proving speed crossed the real-time threshold for Ethereum blocks.

But the vulnerabilities are equally real. Fiat-Shamir bugs (Frozen Heart, the Last Challenge Attack) demonstrate that the gap between a proof system's mathematical security and its implementation security is where real-world attacks live. The proof core -- the inseparable triad of field, commitment scheme, and arithmetization -- means that Layer 5 cannot be understood in isolation from the layers above and below it.

And we have seen a real system, Midnight, deploy Halo 2 in production with a four-phase transaction pipeline whose proof generation latency we measured. This is the state of the art for privacy-preserving blockchain computation: mathematically rigorous, practically functional, and waiting for the performance frontier to catch up.

The certificate is sealed. But we have been treating the sealing mechanism as a black box -- we know it produces trustworthy certificates, but we have not examined what makes the seal unforgeable. What mathematical hardness assumptions prevent a forger from creating a convincing fake? Why do we believe these assumptions hold? And what happens if a quantum computer shatters them?

These are the questions of Layer 6. The seal works because certain mathematical problems are hard. The next chapter examines those problems -- the foundations that make the entire magic trick possible.
