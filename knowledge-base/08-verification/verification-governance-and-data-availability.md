# Verification, Governance, and Data Availability

This document covers Layer 7: verifier economics, implementation bugs, aggregation, governance attacks, and the data-availability infrastructure that determines whether proofs matter in production.

*"The audience can be deceived -- or worse, someone can replace the audience entirely."*

## The Social Layer

Every layer of the zero-knowledge stack we have examined so far -- the ceremony, the language, the witness, the arithmetization, the proof system, the cryptographic primitives -- converges on a single moment: a piece of software reads a proof and says *yes* or *no*.

That piece of software is the audience. We established this in Chapter 1: the verifier is the audience, the entity that watches the trick and renders its verdict. On Ethereum, the audience is a smart contract. On Midnight, it is a node. On a private enterprise chain, it might be a service running in a data center. Whatever form it takes, the verifier is the point where all the private magic becomes a public verdict.

And here is the uncomfortable truth that most explanations of zero-knowledge proofs prefer to gloss over: the audience can be replaced. Not by breaking the cryptography. Not by forging a proof. By something much simpler.

By changing the software.

If three people on a governance multisig can upgrade the verifier contract to one that accepts every proof -- or no proofs, or only their proofs -- then the 128-bit security of the proof system, the million-dollar ceremony, the carefully audited circuits, all of it becomes decorative. The math does not protect you from the admin key.

This chapter is about what happens after the proof is generated. It is about gas costs, data availability, implementation bugs, governance attacks, and the social structures that determine whether the cryptographic guarantees from Layers 1 through 6 actually reach the people they are supposed to protect.

Layer 7 is where cryptography meets politics. And politics, as a rule, wins.

Layer 7 carries four distinct responsibilities, and this chapter treats each in turn. First: the *economics* of rendering a verdict — what does verification cost, and who pays? Second: *implementation vulnerabilities* that can corrupt the verdict — Fiat-Shamir transcript bugs that enable proof forgery. Third: *governance structures* that can override the verdict — multisig attacks, upgrade mechanisms, and the social layer above the math. Fourth: *aggregation and data availability infrastructure* that sits between the prover and the verifier — SHARP, blob economics, and the emerging DA marketplace. These four concerns are operationally convergent — they all determine whether the audience's verdict is trustworthy — but they are logically distinct. A system can have perfect verification economics and catastrophic governance. Separating the concerns makes the trust analysis sharper.

## The Price of a Verdict

Let us start with money, because money clarifies.

A Groth16 proof verification on Ethereum uses the BN254 elliptic curve pairing precompiles introduced in the Byzantium hard fork (2017) and made cheaper by the Istanbul upgrade's EIP-1108 (2019). The gas cost breaks down as follows:

| Component | Gas Cost |
|-----------|----------|
| Pairing check (4 pairings via EIP-1108) | 181,000 |
| Calldata (256-byte proof) | 4,096 |
| EVM scaffolding | ~1,600 |
| Per public input | ~7,160 each |
| **Total (fixed, no public inputs)** | **~207,700** |

The formula is roughly $(181 + 6L) \times 1{,}000$ gas for $L$ public inputs. At typical Ethereum gas prices and ETH valuations, this works out to somewhere between fifty cents and two dollars per verification. Call it a dollar.

One dollar. To check a proof that summarizes thousands, or millions, of computations. That is the economic engine of the entire zero-knowledge rollup industry. It is also worth noting: the cost of *rendering a verdict* on an arbitrarily complex computation is effectively fixed. The computation can be ten steps or ten billion. The verdict costs the same.

But notice what that dollar buys. It buys a *Groth16* verification. Groth16 requires a trusted setup (Layer 1), uses elliptic curve pairings on BN254 (Layer 6), and produces the smallest proofs in the field -- three group elements that fit in a tweet. The cheapness of the verdict is not free. It is subsidized by decisions made five layers below.

What about STARKs? The paper being revised presents STARK verification as expensive -- two to five million gas -- and contrasts this with SNARK cheapness. This framing was arguably accurate in 2022. It is misleading in 2026. The reason is simple: nobody posts raw STARKs to Ethereum.

The actual production pipeline looks like this:

1. Generate a STARK proof (transparent, no trusted setup, large -- hundreds of kilobytes).
2. Recursively compress the STARK through multiple rounds.
3. Wrap the final compressed STARK inside a Groth16 proof.
4. Post the Groth16 proof to Ethereum.

Starknet's SHARP (Shared Prover) does this. Succinct's SP1 does this. Polygon's CDK does this. The verifier contract on Ethereum sees Groth16 in every case. The "STARK path" and the "SNARK path" converge at the courthouse door.

The actual cost differential between the two approaches, then, is not the 10-25x that a naive comparison of raw STARK versus Groth16 verification would suggest. It is closer to 2x -- the overhead of the wrapping step, amortized across many proofs. The inner proof system matters enormously for prover economics (speed, hardware requirements, parallelizability), but the on-chain verification cost is nearly identical.

There is a throughput ceiling too. An Ethereum block has a 30-million-gas limit (raised from the historical 15 million, with a 45-million effective target under various proposals). At 207,700 gas per Groth16 verification, you can fit roughly 150 to 225 verifications per block. That sounds like a lot, until you realize that each verification corresponds to a batch of rollup transactions. If Ethereum hosts 50 rollups and each wants to verify once per block, they consume less than a quarter of the block's capacity. But if we want real-time proving (verification every L1 slot), with hundreds of rollups and bridges, the verification gas budget starts to matter.

FFLONK, an alternative to Groth16, costs roughly 236,000 gas per verification -- slightly more, but with the advantage of a universal trusted setup (one ceremony works for all circuits, unlike Groth16's per-circuit setup). The gas difference is marginal. The governance and operational difference -- not needing a new ceremony for each circuit -- is substantial.

### The Verification-Data Seesaw

Before March 2024, the dominant cost of running a ZK rollup on Ethereum was not verification. It was data availability. Posting transaction data (or state diffs) as calldata cost roughly 16 gas per byte. A typical rollup batch might include hundreds of kilobytes of data, costing millions of gas -- dwarfing the ~200,000 gas for the proof check.

EIP-4844, deployed in the Dencun upgrade on March 13, 2024, changed this calculus fundamentally. It introduced "blob transactions" -- a new data type designed specifically for rollup data. Each blob contains 4,096 field elements of 32 bytes (~128 KB), with a target of 3 blobs per block and a maximum of 6. Critically, blobs have their own fee market, separate from Ethereum's execution gas market, operating under a blob-specific EIP-1559 mechanism.

The result: rollup data costs dropped by 10-100x overnight. Blob fees settled near zero because demand was well below the 3-blob target -- as of mid-2024, only about 34% of Ethereum blocks contained any blobs at all, and the average was 1.33 blob transactions per block.

But Ethereum did not stop at EIP-4844. Two subsequent upgrades expanded DA capacity further:

- **Pectra** (May 2025): Doubled blob targets from 3 to 6, and maximum from 6 to approximately 9.
- **Fusaka** (December 2025): Introduced PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling), implementing a distributed sampling scheme that raised the blob target to 14 and maximum to 21 -- an 8x increase in DA capacity over the original EIP-4844 specification.

The seesaw has tipped. With blob fees near zero and DA capacity expanding rapidly, the ~200,000 gas verification cost has become the *dominant* L1 settlement expense for many ZK rollups. This inversion matters because it changes what is worth optimizing. Before EIP-4844, the rational investment was in compression (minimizing data). After EIP-4844, the rational investment is in proof aggregation (amortizing verification across more transactions per batch) and in cheaper verification schemes.

### Beyond Ethereum: The DA Marketplace

Ethereum is not the only source of data availability. A marketplace has emerged:

**Celestia** charges roughly $0.07 per megabyte for data availability, compared to Ethereum's blob cost of roughly $3.83 per megabyte (when blobs are priced above the floor). Celestia achieves this by being a purpose-built DA layer -- it provides data ordering and availability guarantees without executing any transactions. The intellectual lineage traces directly to Mustafa Al-Bassam's LazyLedger (2019), which proposed a blockchain that does nothing but guarantee data is available and ordered, leaving execution to sovereign rollups that interpret their own transaction rules.

**EigenDA V2** targets 100 megabytes per second of throughput -- roughly two orders of magnitude more than Ethereum's native DA capacity. It achieves this by leveraging Ethereum's security through restaking (EigenLayer), where validators stake ETH to back DA guarantees.

**Avail** offers a third alternative, with its own DAS-based light client verification model.

The choice between these DA layers is not purely technical. A rollup that uses Celestia for DA instead of Ethereum blobs trades Ethereum's full consensus security for lower costs. This is a Layer 7 governance decision with Layer 6 security implications: the data availability guarantee is only as strong as the weakest link in the DA provider's consensus mechanism.

### Data Availability

The term "data availability" is one of those phrases that sounds self-explanatory and is not. It does not mean "the data exists somewhere." It does not mean "the data is stored on a server." It means something specific and testable: if you send a transaction to a rollup, can any participant in the world reconstruct the rollup's complete state using only publicly available data?

If yes, the rollup has data availability. Anyone can verify that the rollup operator is honest by replaying all transactions from genesis and checking that the claimed state matches the computed state. If no -- if some of the data is withheld, stored only on the operator's private servers, or available only to a privileged set of participants -- then the operator could cheat and nobody would know. The operator could include a transaction that steals every user's funds, prove that the resulting state transition is "valid" (because the ZK proof only proves that *some* valid transition occurred), and nobody could challenge it because nobody can see the inputs.

This is the critical subtlety that connects data availability to zero-knowledge proofs. A ZK proof proves that a state transition was computed correctly. It proves that if you start from state S and apply transactions T, you arrive at state S'. What it does *not* prove -- what it *cannot* prove, by design -- is what state S actually was. The proof attests to the correctness of the computation, not the availability of the inputs. If the operator claims the starting state was S but actually started from a fabricated state S_fake, the ZK proof will happily prove that the transition from S_fake was computed correctly. Without DA, nobody can verify the starting point.

Data availability is the anchor. The ZK proof is the chain. Without the anchor, the chain secures nothing.

The three DA strategies represent different points on the cost-security tradeoff:

**Ethereum calldata** is the oldest and most expensive approach. Transaction data is posted directly as calldata in Ethereum L1 transactions, stored permanently by every full node, and protected by Ethereum's full consensus security. The cost is high -- 16 gas per byte of calldata -- but the guarantee is absolute: if Ethereum's consensus is secure, the data is available. This was the only option before March 2024, and it made rollup operations expensive enough that most of the early rollup economics were dominated by DA costs rather than verification costs.

**Ethereum blobs** (EIP-4844 and successors) are the middle ground. Blob data is posted to Ethereum and protected by Ethereum's consensus during a pruning window (currently approximately 18 days), after which nodes may discard it. The data is available long enough for any challenge period to complete, and it is significantly cheaper than calldata because blobs have their own fee market and do not compete with execution gas. This is the default choice for most production rollups in 2026.

**External DA layers** (Celestia, EigenDA, Avail) are the cheapest option with a different trust model. The data is posted to a separate blockchain or protocol that specializes in data ordering and availability guarantees. The cost can be 10-100x lower than Ethereum blobs. The tradeoff is that the DA guarantee depends on the external protocol's consensus and validator set, not Ethereum's. A rollup using Celestia for DA inherits Celestia's security assumptions. If Celestia's validator set colludes or fails, the rollup's data may become unavailable even though Ethereum itself is functioning correctly.

The choice of DA strategy is, in practice, one of the most consequential governance decisions a rollup team makes. It determines the rollup's operating cost, its security model, its relationship to Ethereum's consensus, and its vulnerability to the DA-saturation attacks discussed later in this chapter. It is a Layer 7 decision with implications that cascade through every layer below.

## When the Transcript Lies: Fiat-Shamir Vulnerabilities

Chapter 6 introduced the Fiat-Shamir transform as the mechanism that seals Layer 5 proofs into non-interactive certificates, and flagged the binding requirement: the hash must include every public value the verifier would have seen. This section examines what happens when that requirement is violated in production -- and why the consequences are uniquely catastrophic at Layer 7, where on-chain verifiers are permissionless and exploitation is automated.

The Fiat-Shamir heuristic is the mechanism that converts an interactive proof (where the verifier asks random questions in real time) into a non-interactive one (where the prover simulates the verifier's questions using a hash function). Every non-interactive ZK proof deployed on a blockchain uses Fiat-Shamir. It is the invisible thread that holds the entire verification model together.

And it is the single most dangerous implementation surface in the entire stack.

### Frozen Heart (2022)

In April 2022, Trail of Bits disclosed a vulnerability class they called "Frozen Heart" (a backronym: Forging Of Zero kNowledge proofs). The core error was simple. Devastatingly simple. Multiple independent implementations of ZK proof systems omitted public inputs from the Fiat-Shamir hash computation.

The implementations affected were not obscure academic prototypes. They were production-grade libraries used by real projects:

- **Dusk Network** (PLONK implementation)
- **Iden3/SnarkJS** (Groth16, used by Circom)
- **ConsenSys/gnark** (PLONK implementation)
- **ING Bank's zkrp** (Bulletproofs)
- **SECBIT Labs' ckb-zkp** (Groth16)
- **Adjoint Inc.'s bulletproofs** (Bulletproofs)

Six implementations. Three different proof systems. Four different organizations. All made the same mistake: they left the public inputs out of the hash that generates the verifier's challenges.

The consequence is total soundness failure. A malicious prover can forge proofs for *arbitrary false statements*. Not with some small probability. With certainty. The "proof" passes verification because the challenges are no longer bound to the specific statement being proved. The sealed certificate attests to nothing. It is wax without an impression.

The rule that was violated is not subtle: the Fiat-Shamir hash must include *all* public values from the ZK statement and *all* public values computed during the proof. Every commitment, every public input, every piece of data that the verifier would have seen in the interactive version must go into the hash. Omit any of it, and the binding between challenge and statement dissolves.

### The Last Challenge Attack (2024)

The Last Challenge Attack, discovered during an audit of Linea's PLONK verifier in the gnark library, is a more surgical variant of the same disease. In KZG-based proof systems, the verifier often batches multiple polynomial evaluations using a random "batching challenge" derived via Fiat-Shamir. The Last Challenge Attack exploits the case where this batching challenge is computed from a *truncated* transcript -- one that excludes the evaluation proofs themselves.

The attack is elegant in the way that a perfectly executed heist is elegant. The malicious prover:

1. Sets arbitrary (false) public inputs and proof components.
2. Computes the batching challenge from the truncated transcript.
3. Solves a linear system for the missing evaluation proofs.
4. The vulnerable verifier accepts the forged proof with probability 1.

Not "with high probability." With certainty. The forged proof is deterministically constructed to pass verification. The audience has been compromised not by force but by omission -- a single value left out of a hash, and the entire edifice of mathematical certainty collapses.

The gnark advisory (GHSA-7p92-x423-vwj6) confirmed the vulnerability. The fix was straightforward: compute the batching challenge only *after* all evaluation proofs are included in the transcript. But the vulnerability existed in a production-quality library used by multiple rollup teams.

### Solana ZK ElGamal (2025)

The pattern repeated in 2025 on Solana, where the ZK ElGamal implementation was found to have a Fiat-Shamir transcript that omitted the prover's challenge from the hash computation. Same class of error. Same catastrophic consequence. The same lesson, unlearned for the third time.

### The Pattern

These are not isolated incidents. They are symptoms of a structural problem: the Fiat-Shamir heuristic is easy to describe ("hash everything the verifier would see") and remarkably easy to get wrong in implementation. The specification says "include all public values." The implementation omits one, because it seemed redundant, or because it made the code cleaner, or because the developer did not understand *why* it needed to be there.

For on-chain verifiers, this class of vulnerability is uniquely dangerous. An on-chain verifier is permissionless -- anyone can submit a proof. If the verifier's Fiat-Shamir transcript is incomplete, exploitation is automated and instantaneous. There is no human in the loop to notice that something looks wrong. The forged proof passes the smart contract's checks, the state transition is accepted, and the attacker drains whatever value the rollup is protecting.

Every on-chain SNARK verifier -- Groth16, PLONK, FFLONK, any KZG-based scheme -- must be audited specifically and primarily for Fiat-Shamir transcript completeness. This should be the first check in any security review, not an item buried in a general audit report.

## Governance: The Achilles Heel

If Fiat-Shamir bugs are the most exploited *implementation* vulnerability in zero-knowledge systems, governance is the most exploited *architectural* vulnerability. And unlike Fiat-Shamir bugs, governance vulnerabilities cannot be fixed with better code review. They are features, not bugs.

Here the story changes genre. Until now, we have been watching a technical narrative -- mathematicians and engineers building increasingly sophisticated proof systems. Now the camera pulls back, and the audience discovers it has been watching a different show than it thought. The threats at Layer 7 are not mathematical. They are human.

### The Beanstalk Flash Loan Attack ($182M, April 2022)

Beanstalk was a permissionless stablecoin protocol -- a DeFi project built on the idea that an algorithmic stablecoin (called Bean) could maintain its dollar peg through a credit-based system of debt, deposits, and incentive cycles. The protocol had attracted over $100 million in total value locked. It had a community. It had audits. It had a governance mechanism that allowed holders of the protocol's internal Stalk token to propose and vote on changes to the system's parameters, its contracts, its entire economic logic.

The mathematics were sound. The smart contracts were audited. The governance mechanism was functioning exactly as designed.

That last sentence is the important one. Remember it.

Beanstalk's governance had one feature that seemed reasonable at the time: the emergency commit threshold. If a proposal attracted more than two-thirds of total Stalk voting power, it could be executed immediately -- no waiting period, no time lock, no multi-day deliberation window. The designers' reasoning was practical: if a supermajority of stakeholders agreed on something, why force them to wait? Speed was a feature. In a fast-moving DeFi market, the ability to respond quickly to exploits or market conditions was considered an advantage.

On April 17, 2022, at approximately 12:24 UTC, someone demonstrated why speed is also a weapon.

The attacker -- whose identity remains unknown to this day -- began by taking flash loans from three decentralized lending protocols: Aave, Uniswap V2, and SushiSwap. A flash loan is a peculiar instrument unique to programmable blockchains: it allows you to borrow any amount of money, provided you repay it within the same transaction. If you cannot repay, the entire transaction reverts as if it never happened. The borrowing cost is essentially zero -- just gas fees and a small protocol fee. There is no credit check. There is no collateral. There is no application form. You simply ask for the money, use it, and return it, all within a single atomic operation that takes seconds.

On this day, the attacker borrowed approximately $1 billion in assets. One billion dollars, for thirteen seconds.

With the borrowed capital, the attacker swapped into Beanstalk's liquidity pools, acquiring enough of the protocol's Stalk and Seed tokens to control over 67% of total governance voting power. This was not a theoretical majority. It was an absolute supermajority -- enough to clear the emergency commit threshold.

Then came the proposals. BIP-18 was the payload: a governance proposal whose code, when executed, would transfer all of Beanstalk's protocol reserves -- every Bean, every LP token, every asset in the Silo -- to a wallet controlled by the attacker. The code was not hidden. It was right there on the blockchain, readable by anyone who looked. But governance proposals are submitted and voted upon, not scrutinized line by line in the seconds between submission and execution, and nobody was watching for a proposal backed by a billion dollars of borrowed voting power.

BIP-19 was the other proposal: a donation of $250,000 to the Ukraine war relief wallet. Whether this was misdirection, moral compensation, ironic commentary, or simply a way to make the governance transaction look routine is a question the attacker left permanently unanswered. It remains one of the small, unsettling details that elevate this from a theft to a performance.

The attacker voted on BIP-18 with the borrowed supermajority. The emergency commit threshold was cleared. The governance system did what governance systems do: it executed the will of the majority. The protocol's reserves flowed from the Silo to the attacker's address. The attacker unwound the liquidity positions, converted the assets, repaid the flash loans to Aave, Uniswap, and SushiSwap -- in full, with fees -- and pocketed the difference.

Thirteen seconds. Borrow, vote, execute, extract, repay. The entire heist was a single atomic transaction on Ethereum. If any step had failed -- if the flash loan had been too small, if the voting power had been insufficient, if the repayment had come up short -- every step would have reverted, and the blockchain would have recorded nothing. But no step failed. The transaction succeeded. The money was gone.

Total protocol loss: $182 million in value destroyed. Net extraction by the attacker: approximately $77 million in non-Bean assets -- the portion that had real market value independent of the now-collapsed protocol. The Bean stablecoin depegged immediately and never recovered. The protocol's entire treasury was emptied in a single block.

The root cause was not a code vulnerability. No contract was exploited in the traditional sense. No buffer was overflowed. No access control was bypassed. No reentrancy was triggered. The governance mechanism worked exactly as designed. It accepted a vote from a stakeholder with a supermajority. It executed the proposal that the supermajority approved. It transferred the funds that the proposal specified. Every line of code behaved correctly.

The system was not broken. The system was *used*.

The lesson lands differently depending on who you are. If you are a protocol designer, the lesson is about time locks and minimum voting periods and the danger of emergency execution without delay. If you are a governance theorist, the lesson is about the difference between ownership and rental -- the attacker did not own the voting power; he rented it for the cost of a flash loan fee. If you are building a ZK rollup with token-weighted governance over an upgradeable verifier contract, the lesson is existential: governance that can be rented by the hour is governance that can be captured in seconds. The flash loan is the instrument. The vulnerability is the assumption -- the assumption that token holders are stakeholders, that voting power reflects long-term commitment, that the people who hold the keys today will hold them tomorrow. Flash loans dissolve that assumption into nothing. For the thirteen seconds that matter, anyone with gas money is a supermajority stakeholder.

### The Tornado Cash Governance Attack (May 2023)

Tornado Cash was a privacy protocol built on zero-knowledge proofs -- the very technology this book describes. It used ZK proofs to break the on-chain link between depositors and withdrawers. You deposit ETH into a pool, receive a cryptographic note, and later withdraw from the pool using a ZK proof that demonstrates you possess a valid note without revealing which deposit was yours. The cryptography was elegant, well-audited, and provably sound. The protocol's privacy guarantees were genuine. Its governance was controlled by a DAO with TORN token voting, and the governance was not.

The attack, when it came in May 2023, unfolded like a stage magic trick -- not the kind where a rabbit appears from a hat, but the kind where the audience watches the magician's right hand while the left hand replaces the entire stage.

To understand the trick, you need to understand two pieces of Ethereum infrastructure that most users never think about.

The first is `CREATE2`. On Ethereum, when you deploy a contract, it gets an address. Normally, this address is derived from the deployer's address and a nonce (a sequential counter), so it is effectively unpredictable. `CREATE2`, introduced in EIP-1014, changes the formula: the new contract's address is derived from the deployer's address, a chosen salt, and the *hash of the bytecode being deployed*. This means you can calculate a contract's address before deploying it. More importantly -- and this is the key to the trick -- if you deploy an intermediary factory contract that itself uses `CREATE` (the old opcode), and that factory deploys a child contract, and then you destroy both the factory and the child via `selfdestruct`, and then you redeploy the factory at its original `CREATE2` address, the factory's nonce resets to zero, and it can deploy a *completely different* child contract at the *same address* where the original child lived. The address is reused. The code is not.

The second is the proxy pattern. Tornado Cash's governance system, like many DAO governance contracts, used a proxy architecture (EIP-1967/UUPS). In a proxy pattern, there is a permanent proxy contract at a fixed address that users interact with. This proxy does not contain the actual governance logic. Instead, it contains a pointer -- a storage slot at a specific, standardized location -- that holds the address of an *implementation* contract. When you call a function on the proxy, the proxy uses `delegatecall` to forward your call to whatever implementation contract the pointer currently references. The proxy's storage is used, but the implementation's code runs. This means whoever can change the pointer controls what code executes when anyone interacts with the governance system. Change the pointer, and you change the governance -- silently, without deploying a new visible contract, without changing the address that everyone knows and trusts.

Now the trick.

The attacker submitted a governance proposal to the Tornado Cash DAO. The proposal looked benign. Its description claimed it was identical to Proposal 16, a previously approved and uncontroversial proposal that penalized certain relayers for cheating. The voters did what voters do in a DAO with dozens of proposals per month: they read the description, saw it matched something familiar, and voted yes. They did not decompile and audit the proposal's bytecode. Why would they? The description said it was the same proposal. Reviewing raw EVM bytecode is not a skill most governance participants possess, and the social norm in DAO governance is to review descriptions, not opcodes.

The vote passed. The proposal was approved by the DAO's governance process, with legitimate TORN token holders casting legitimate votes through the legitimate governance interface. Democracy had spoken.

Then the floor opened.

The proposal contract that the voters had approved contained a hidden capability: `selfdestruct`. This EVM opcode does exactly what its name suggests -- it destroys the contract at a given address, wiping its bytecode from the blockchain state and sending any remaining ETH balance to a specified recipient. After the vote passed and the proposal was executed, the attacker triggered `selfdestruct` on the proposal contract. The code that the voters had approved ceased to exist on the blockchain.

Then the attacker redeployed. Using the `CREATE2` intermediary trick described above, the attacker deployed entirely new bytecode at the same address where the original proposal contract had lived. The Tornado Cash governance system still held a reference to that address. It still trusted that address. But the code living there was now completely different from what the voters had approved.

The new code did one thing: it gave the attacker the ability to mint TORN governance tokens to themselves -- 10,000 TORN per iteration, repeatable, until the attacker held 1.2 million votes. The entire legitimate DAO held roughly 700,000 votes. The attacker now controlled a permanent, unchallengeable supermajority.

The misdirection was total. The malicious code was not present during the vote. It did not exist when the voters examined the proposal. The voters approved code A. The attacker destroyed code A and deployed code B at the same address. The governance system, still pointing at that address, treated code B as if it had the full authority of the vote that approved code A. The signed letter's text changed after the seal was broken -- and the seal still looked intact.

Impact: complete control over Tornado Cash's governance. The attacker could drain locked tokens, modify protocol parameters, brick the router contract, or do anything else the governance system was authorized to do. Approximately $2.17 million was stolen directly. The TORN token price dropped 36% as the market priced in the total capture of the protocol's decision-making apparatus. A privacy protocol whose zero-knowledge cryptography was unbroken -- whose mathematical guarantees remained perfectly sound -- was nevertheless fully compromised, because the human layer that governed it was exploitable through misdirection and code replacement.

The root cause was two vulnerabilities woven together: a social one and a technical one. The social vulnerability was that voters verified the proposal's *description* but not its *code*. This is normal human behavior. It is also, in hindsight, a systemic weakness of every DAO that presents proposals as human-readable summaries rather than requiring formal verification of the underlying bytecode. The technical vulnerability was the `selfdestruct` + `CREATE2` pattern, which allowed post-approval code replacement at a trusted address -- a capability that the governance system had no mechanism to detect or prevent.

Neither vulnerability alone would have been sufficient. Together, they allowed an attacker to go beyond exploiting the governance -- to *become* the governance. The Beanstalk attacker rented governance power for thirteen seconds. The Tornado Cash attacker did something structurally worse: he permanently replaced the governance with himself. Beanstalk was a heist. Tornado Cash was a coup.

### ZK Rollup Governance Risk

Both attacks targeted governance mechanisms that controlled upgradeable contracts. And ZK rollup verifier contracts are almost always deployed behind upgradeable proxy patterns -- the same patterns catalogued in the 2023 survey by Meisami and Bodell, which documented EIP-1967 (OpenZeppelin transparent proxy), EIP-1822 (UUPS), EIP-2535 (Diamonds), and Beacon proxies.

The proxy pattern introduces its own attack surface beyond governance: storage layout corruption when state variables are reordered across upgrades, function selector collisions between proxy admin and implementation functions, and the fundamental risk that `delegatecall` means all storage operations in the implementation affect the proxy's storage.

But the deepest risk is simpler than any of these. Whoever controls the proxy admin controls the verifier. If the governance mechanism that controls the proxy admin is vulnerable to flash loans (Beanstalk-style) or code replacement (Tornado Cash-style), then the entire rollup's security reduces to the security of its governance mechanism.

The cryptography could be perfect. The ceremony could have had a million participants. The circuits could be formally verified. None of it matters if an attacker can replace the verifier contract with one that returns `true` for every proof. Six layers of mathematical elegance, and the seventh is a multisig.

### L2Beat's Stages Framework

L2Beat, the independent rollup monitoring organization, has formalized the maturity of rollup decentralization into three stages:

**Stage 0 -- Full Training Wheels**: The rollup is effectively run by its operators. It must have source-available software for state reconstruction from L1 data, and it must have *some* proof system to qualify. But governance can override everything. Most rollup deployments begin here.

**Stage 1 -- Limited Training Wheels**: The proof system is fully functional. Fraud proof submission (for optimistic rollups) or verification (for ZK rollups) is permissionless. Users can exit without operator coordination through forced inclusion or escape hatches. A Security Council may override the proof system for bug fixes, but with constraints -- for example, a 6-of-8 multisig with a 7-day delay.

**Stage 2 -- No Training Wheels**: The rollup is fully managed by smart contracts. The proof system is permissionless. Users get at least 30 days' notice for unwanted upgrades. The Security Council is restricted to adjudicating on-chain-provable soundness errors only. Users are fully protected from governance attacks.

As of early 2026, most major ZK rollups are at Stage 0 or Stage 1. Achieving Stage 2 requires either formally verified verifier contracts (so bugs are unlikely enough that upgrade capability can be removed), multiple independent implementations that cross-check each other, or bounded upgrade windows with mandatory exit periods of 30 or more days.

The tension is real and irreducible. ZK verifier contracts are among the most complex smart contracts ever deployed. They implement pairing checks, polynomial evaluations, and Fiat-Shamir transcript verification in a language (Solidity, or Yul) that was not designed for this kind of arithmetic. The probability of bugs is non-trivial. But the ability to fix bugs via governance is the same ability that allows governance to introduce them.

Stage 2 is where the cryptographic guarantees from Layers 1 through 6 actually bind. Below Stage 2, they are advisory. A Stage 0 rollup with 256-bit proof security is, from the user's perspective, only as secure as the governance multisig's operational security.

## Proof Aggregation: The Missing Layer

Between the prover (who generates proofs) and the on-chain verifier (who checks them), a significant infrastructure layer has emerged that the seven-layer model does not account for: proof aggregation services.

**SHARP (Shared Prover)**, built by StarkWare for Starknet, is the original aggregation service. Multiple applications submit their execution traces to SHARP, which generates a single STARK proof covering all of them, then wraps that proof in Groth16 for on-chain verification. The verification gas cost is amortized across all participating applications.

**Aligned Layer**, launched on mainnet with over $11 billion in restaked ETH (via EigenLayer), provides verification-as-a-service. Rollups and applications submit proofs to Aligned Layer, which batches and verifies them, posting the aggregated result to Ethereum.

**NEBRA**, live since August 2024, provides proof aggregation with a focus on universal verification -- supporting multiple proof systems (Groth16, PLONK, STARK) within a single aggregation layer.

The economic logic is straightforward. If a single Groth16 verification costs ~200,000 gas, and an aggregation service can batch 100 proofs into a single on-chain verification, the per-proof verification cost drops from ~$1 to ~$0.01. At sufficient volume, aggregation makes proof verification nearly free.

But aggregation introduces a new trust assumption. Users must trust that the aggregation service correctly includes their proof in the batch, and that the aggregated proof faithfully represents all constituent proofs. If the aggregation service is centralized (as SHARP is for Starknet), this is a single point of failure at Layer 7 that can undermine the decentralization guarantees of the underlying proof system.

## Case Study: Midnight and the Three-Token Architecture

Midnight, developed by IOG (Input Output Global), provides an instructive case study for Layer 7 because it makes different architectural choices than the Ethereum rollup model. Where Ethereum rollups post proofs to a general-purpose L1 and rely on upgradeable verifier contracts, Midnight integrates verification into its consensus layer and uses a novel three-token economic model that directly shapes the verification experience.

### The Verification Pipeline

Midnight uses a split execution model. Smart contracts are written in Compact, a domain-specific ZK language, but they never execute on-chain in the traditional sense:

1. The user's SDK executes the Compact circuit locally, computing the new state.
2. A proof server generates a ZK proof that the state transition is valid.
3. The SDK packages the proof, fee inputs, and state delta into a transaction.
4. Every Midnight node verifies the proof against the circuit's verifier keys, which were deployed on-chain when the contract was created.
5. If valid, the blockchain updates the contract's ledger state.

The critical difference from the Ethereum rollup model: verification is not performed by a specialized verifier contract that can be upgraded via governance. It is performed by every node as part of consensus. The verifier keys are stored on-chain at the contract address and are immutable -- once deployed, a contract's verification logic cannot be changed. A new contract must be deployed for logic changes.

This is a strong answer to the governance-as-attack-surface problem. You cannot upgrade what is immutable. But it creates a different problem: what happens when there is a bug? The answer is migration -- deploy a corrected contract and convince users to move to it. This is slower and messier than a governance upgrade, but it cannot be exploited by an attacker with admin keys. The tradeoff is explicit: Midnight accepts the inconvenience of immutability in exchange for immunity to the Beanstalk-style attack.

### Three Tokens, Three Privacy Levels

Midnight's three-token model is not an arbitrary design choice. Each token represents a different point on the privacy-transparency spectrum, and together they create an economic system where verification costs, privacy guarantees, and governance rights are separate and independently tunable.

**Night** is the unshielded native token. It is fully transparent -- all operations are publicly visible on the ledger, stored as UTXOs with public-key authentication. Night serves two purposes: staking (and therefore governance) and backing for DUST generation. Every Night token registered for dust generation produces DUST over time at a deterministic rate.

**Shielded tokens** are ZK-private custom tokens. Any Compact contract can mint shielded tokens with unique type identifiers ("colors"). Balances and transaction details are hidden via zero-knowledge proofs. Shielded tokens use UTXOs with Pedersen commitments -- only the key holder can view or modify wallet state. All shielded token transfers go through contracts, not direct peer-to-peer.

**DUST** is the fee token. All transaction fees are denominated in DUST, but DUST is not mined or minted in the traditional sense. It is a time-dependent scalar computed from Night holdings. A user registers Night UTXOs for dust generation, and DUST accumulates over time according to a deterministic formula with parameters for rate, maximum cap, and creation time.

This creates a novel fee model with direct implications for verification economics:

- **No fee market**: Fees are computed deterministically, not bid. There is no gas auction.
- **Rate-limited spam**: Transaction throughput is naturally limited by DUST regeneration rate relative to Night holdings. An attacker who wants to spam the network must hold (or acquire) Night tokens and wait for DUST to regenerate.
- **Staking alignment**: Only Night holders can generate DUST. Transaction capability is tied to network participation.
- **Time-gated recovery**: A user who has spent all their DUST must wait for regeneration before transacting again. This is a natural circuit breaker against denial-of-service attacks.

### Disclosure Rules and Compiler-Enforced Privacy

In Compact, everything is private by default. Values only appear on-chain when the developer explicitly calls `disclose()`. The Compact compiler enforces this through static disclosure analysis at compile time -- privacy is a compiler guarantee, not developer discipline.

What must be disclosed includes contract ledger state (any `export ledger` field), counter increments and decrements, state transition deltas (so validators can verify the new state), nullifiers (to prevent double-spending), and hash commitments (stored for future verification). What stays private includes secret keys, witness values (circuit private inputs), shielded balances, vote choices (only aggregate tallies change on-chain), authorization preimages, and computation logic (ZK proof hides the execution path).

This compiler-enforced privacy boundary is a significant Layer 7 innovation. In the Ethereum model, what is public and what is private depends on the developer's care in managing calldata, events, and storage. In Midnight, the compiler draws the line, and crossing it requires an explicit annotation that is visible in code review.

### Private Governance

Midnight's DAO governance pattern demonstrates what private on-chain governance can look like:

- **Anonymous identity**: Voters prove membership via hash commitments, never revealing their real identity.
- **Weighted voting**: Contract-state token balances serve as anonymous voting weights via ZK circuit reads.
- **Per-proposal nullifier domains**: Each proposal has its own nullifier space, preventing double-voting while allowing participation across multiple proposals.
- **Vote privacy**: The voter's choice remains private -- only the aggregate tally changes on-chain.
- **Irreversible state machines**: Proposal status is encoded as counter increments (0 unused, 1 open, 2 approved, 3 executed), and counters are monotonically increasing, so state transitions are irreversible by construction.

The multi-signature treasury adds M-of-N threshold approval with propose/approve/execute circuits, where signer identity is verified via hash commitment and double-vote prevention uses per-(proposal, signer) nullifiers.

Every design choice is a direct architectural response to the attacks we just witnessed. Anonymous weighted voting means an attacker cannot flash-loan governance tokens and vote -- they would need to know the secret key that corresponds to a registered hash commitment, and flash-loaning tokens does not give them that. Irreversible state machines mean a proposal cannot be rolled back after execution. Per-proposal nullifier isolation means vote manipulation in one proposal cannot leak to another.

The Beanstalk attacker borrowed a billion dollars of voting power for the duration of a single transaction. Against Midnight's architecture, that borrowing would be useless. You cannot vote with a key you do not possess.

### The Gaps

Midnight's approach is not without its own Layer 7 vulnerabilities:

- **Protocol upgrade governance**: The documentation does not describe how consensus-level parameters (fee rates, dust generation parameters, consensus rules) are governed. This is the most significant gap. Immutable contracts solve contract-level governance attacks, but someone must still govern the protocol itself.
- **Oracle centralization**: All oracle patterns in the current documentation use single-party authorization via hash commitment. There is no multi-oracle or threshold-oracle pattern. A single compromised oracle can feed false data to every contract that depends on it.
- **Fixed participant sets**: Current governance contracts hardcode 2-3 participant slots. Production governance with dynamic participant sets would require Merkle-tree-based registration, which has been demonstrated (in the lending pool pattern) but not yet integrated into governance contracts.
- **No emergency procedures**: There is no documented kill switch, pause mechanism, or emergency parameter override for deployed contracts. Immutability is a feature for preventing governance attacks, but it is a liability when a critical bug is discovered.

## The Deepest Symmetry

There is a symmetry in the seven-layer model that becomes visible only at Layer 7, and it concerns the nature of trust.

At Layer 1, the setup ceremony, security rests on a social claim: "At least one of N participants honestly destroyed their toxic waste." This is not a mathematical statement. It is a statement about human behavior. You trust the ceremony because you trust that at least one person, out of thousands, did the right thing.

At Layer 7, the verifier deployment, security rests on a parallel social claim: "The governance mechanism that controls the verifier will not be captured by an adversary." This is not a mathematical statement either. It is a statement about institutional design, incentive alignment, and ultimately human judgment.

The layers in between -- the language, the witness, the arithmetization, the proof system, the primitives -- are mathematical. They provide computational guarantees that hold against any polynomial-time adversary. They are the part of the trick that actually works by the laws of mathematics, not by the conventions of human society. But they are sandwiched between two layers of social trust.

None of this represents a failure of the model. It is a description of reality. Zero-knowledge proofs do not eliminate trust. They *compress* it. Instead of trusting a bank with your financial data every day, you trust that a ceremony was run honestly once and that governance will not go rogue in the future. These are weaker assumptions than trusting a single counterparty for every transaction. But they are assumptions nonetheless.

The honest framing is not "trustless." It is "trust-minimized." And the remaining trust assumptions -- ceremony integrity at the bottom, governance integrity at the top -- are worth stating explicitly so that readers can evaluate whether the trust reduction justifies the complexity.

Feynman, who had a gift for puncturing pretension, would probably say something like this: "You have built a beautiful machine that converts social trust into mathematical certainty and back into social trust again. The mathematical part in the middle is genuinely impressive. But do not pretend the social parts at the ends do not exist."

He would be right. And the fact that he would be right is itself the deepest insight Layer 7 has to offer. The magic trick is real. The mathematics works. But the trick is performed for an audience, and the audience is governed by people, and people are not mathematical objects. The security of the whole system is a chain, and the endpoints of that chain are anchored in human soil.

## Pricing Attacks

The relationship between verification costs and data availability costs creates exploitable seams. A 2025 study by Chaliasos et al. identified two novel attack classes that exploit mismatches in how rollups price their three cost dimensions: L2 execution, L1 data availability, and L1 settlement/proving.

### DA-Saturation Attacks

An attacker floods an L2 with data-heavy, compute-light transactions -- essentially random calldata followed by a STOP opcode. Each such transaction is cheap in L2 gas (the computation is trivial) but expensive in L1 DA cost (it fills blob space with incompressible junk). The study found that sustained denial-of-service on Linea cost as little as 0.87 ETH per hour, and on Optimism roughly 2 ETH per 30 minutes.

The effects cascade: the L2 is congested, finality delays increase by 1.45x to 2.73x compared to direct L1 blob stuffing, and the rollup operator hemorrhages money because the fees collected from the spam transactions do not cover the L1 DA costs. All major rollups studied were found susceptible. Four bug bounties, each worth tens of thousands of dollars, were paid.

### Prover-Killer Attacks

These exploit the mismatch between EVM gas metering and ZK proving costs. Not all EVM opcodes are equally expensive to prove in zero knowledge. The study measured "cycles per gas" ratios -- how many proving cycles are needed per unit of gas cost:

| Opcode / Precompile | EVM Gas | Proving Cycles/Gas | Attack Leverage |
|---------------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| JUMPDEST | 1 | 1,039.79 | Very High |
| MODEXP | (varies) | 2,961.72 | Extreme |
| BN_PAIRING | 45,000+ | 1,642.15 | High |
| SHA256 | 60+ | Moderate | Moderate |

A MODEXP attack -- filling blocks with maximum-cost modular exponentiation operations -- delayed finality by 94x (over 8 hours) and cost the rollup operator $42.26 per attack block. The rollup's proving system crashed after 10,266 seconds.

### The Concrete Scenarios

These are not theoretical concerns. They are playbooks.

**DA-saturation in practice.** An attacker constructs transactions that contain the maximum possible calldata -- random bytes, incompressible by design -- followed by a STOP opcode. The EVM execution cost is negligible: STOP costs 0 gas, and the transaction is technically valid. But the data must be posted to L1 for data availability, and incompressible random data consumes maximum blob space. The attacker submits these transactions continuously, filling every blob slot in every Ethereum block with garbage.

The immediate effect: blob fees spike. Ethereum's blob fee market operates under EIP-1559 dynamics -- when blobs are consistently full, the base fee increases exponentially. Under sustained saturation, blob fees can increase by 100x or more within minutes. Every legitimate rollup that needs to post data to Ethereum sees its operating costs spike proportionally. The attacker pays blob fees too, of course, but the attacker's cost is the cost of the attack. Every other rollup's cost is collateral damage.

The secondary effect is subtler and worse: rollup operators, facing unexpectedly high L1 costs, must choose between posting data at a loss (subsidizing operations from their treasury), delaying batch submissions (increasing finality time for users), or raising L2 fees (driving users to competitors). The attacker does not need to sustain the attack indefinitely. A few hours of blob saturation can cause lasting reputational and economic damage to rollups that depend on predictable L1 costs.

The defense is multidimensional fee pricing on the L2 side: a separate DA fee component that adjusts dynamically based on actual L1 blob costs, passed through to users in real time rather than absorbed by the operator. Several rollups have implemented this in response to the Chaliasos findings, but the adjustment is inherently reactive -- the fee increases *after* the attack begins, which means the operator absorbs losses during the lag period.

**Prover-killer in practice.** An attacker submits transactions that are cheap in EVM gas but catastrophically expensive to prove in zero knowledge. The canonical example is MODEXP -- modular exponentiation with maximum-size inputs. The EVM prices MODEXP based on the size of the operands and a formula that was calibrated for native CPU execution, not for ZK circuit execution. A MODEXP operation with 256-byte base, exponent, and modulus costs roughly 200 gas in the EVM. Proving that same operation inside a ZK circuit requires the prover to decompose the modular exponentiation into field arithmetic over the proving system's native field, which involves thousands of multiplication gates per limb, per exponentiation step. The ratio of proving cost to EVM gas cost -- the "cycles per gas" metric -- reaches nearly 3,000 for MODEXP. A single MODEXP transaction can consume as much proving capacity as 3,000 normal transactions.

The attacker does not need exotic tools. They submit valid transactions -- MODEXP calls with legitimate inputs that any EVM will execute without complaint. The transactions pass all validation checks. They pay standard gas fees. They are included in blocks by the sequencer because the sequencer has no reason to reject a valid, fee-paying transaction. But when those blocks reach the prover, the prover must generate a ZK proof of the entire block's execution, including the MODEXP operations. A single block stuffed with MODEXP calls can take the prover 10,000 seconds to prove -- over 2.7 hours for a block that the sequencer produced in seconds.

If the attacker sustains this for multiple blocks, the prover falls behind. Proving latency grows. Finality -- the time before a rollup batch is verified on L1 -- stretches from minutes to hours. The rollup is technically still functioning, but its security guarantee degrades: until the proof is posted and verified, the rollup's state transitions are unproven claims, not verified facts. A sustained prover-killer attack can push a ZK rollup into a state where it behaves, from the user's perspective, more like an optimistic rollup -- running on trust rather than proof, hoping nothing goes wrong during the gap.

The defense requires the sequencer to price transactions based on their *proving cost*, not just their EVM gas cost. This is the multidimensional pricing problem: EVM gas, DA cost, and proving cost are three independent resources, and a single gas price cannot accurately reflect all three. Until rollups implement proving-cost-aware fee markets, the prover-killer attack remains viable against any ZK rollup that prices transactions using only EVM gas metering.

The root cause is fundamental: current rollup fee mechanisms use a single-dimensional gas price that bundles L2 execution, L1 DA, and proving costs into one number. When these three resources have different scarcity profiles, the bundled price necessarily misprices at least one of them. The fix is multidimensional pricing -- separate base fees for each resource type, each following its own EIP-1559-style adjustment mechanism.

## Who Verifies the Verifier?

The verifier smart contract itself can have bugs. The FOOM Club exploit targeted a misconfigured snarkjs deployment where the verification key parameter delta_2 was set equal to gamma_2, weakening the Groth16 verification equation. The proof system was not broken -- the *deployment configuration* was wrong.

The vulnerability is a supply-chain problem. The verifier contract depends on:

1. The proof system specification (mathematical, usually correct).
2. The reference implementation (code, sometimes buggy -- see Frozen Heart).
3. The deployment configuration (operational, frequently wrong).
4. The Ethereum precompiles (hardware/protocol, generally reliable but not immune to bugs).
5. The compiler that compiled the verifier contract (Solidity, Vyper, or Yul -- each with their own bug history).

An analogy to the XZ Utils supply-chain attack (CVE-2024-3094) is apt. In that case, a sophisticated attacker spent years contributing to an open-source compression library, gained maintainer trust, and inserted a backdoor. The same attack vector applies to ZK verifier libraries: snarkjs, gnark, arkworks, and halo2 are open-source projects maintained by small teams. A compromised maintainer could introduce a subtle verification bypass that passes all existing tests.

Verifier ossification -- the strategy of deploying a verifier contract and making it permanently immutable, treating it like a protocol-level constant rather than upgradeable software -- is one defense. But it requires very high confidence in the verifier's correctness, because bugs in an ossified verifier cannot be fixed without deploying an entirely new contract and migrating all dependent applications.

The tradeoff between immutable and upgradeable verifiers is one of the sharpest architectural decisions at Layer 7:

| Property | Immutable Verifier | Upgradeable Verifier |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Bug patching | Impossible without contract migration | Possible via governance vote or multisig |
| Governance capture | Immune — no upgrade path to exploit | Vulnerable — Beanstalk/Tornado Cash-style attacks |
| Regulatory compliance | Fixed at deploy time; cannot adapt | Adaptable to changing requirements |
| User trust model | Trust the code (audit once, rely forever) | Trust the governance (ongoing vigilance) |
| L2Beat Stage | Stage 2 candidate (if verifier is correct) | Stage 0-1 (governance can override proofs) |
| Quantum migration | Requires full system replacement | Can upgrade to PQ verifier via governance |
| Example | Midnight (immutable verifier keys) | Most Ethereum ZK rollups (proxy pattern) |

Neither choice dominates. Immutable verifiers maximize cryptographic integrity at the cost of operational flexibility. Upgradeable verifiers maximize adaptability at the cost of governance risk. The choice reflects a system's threat model: does it fear bugs more, or governance capture more?

---

## On-Chain Verification in 2026

The state of on-chain verification as of early 2026:

**Verification costs** have stabilized. Groth16 on BN254 remains the dominant on-chain proof format, at roughly 200,000-250,000 gas per verification. The verification cost floor is set by the pairing precompile gas schedule, which is a protocol parameter that changes only through Ethereum governance (EIPs and hard forks).

**Data availability** is abundant and cheap. Three Ethereum upgrades in two years (Dencun, Pectra, Fusaka) have expanded DA capacity by roughly 16x. Alternative DA layers (Celestia, EigenDA, Avail) provide even cheaper options at the cost of different security assumptions.

**Governance maturity** lags. Most ZK rollups remain at Stage 0 or Stage 1 of L2Beat's framework. The path to Stage 2 -- where governance can no longer override the proof system -- requires either formally verified verifier contracts, multi-prover architectures, or long mandatory exit windows. No major ZK rollup has achieved Stage 2 as of this writing.

**Fiat-Shamir security** is improving through hard experience. The Frozen Heart disclosure, the Last Challenge Attack, and the Solana ZK ElGamal bug have established Fiat-Shamir transcript completeness as a first-order security property. Audit firms now check for it specifically. But new implementations continue to be written, and the pattern will recur until proof system libraries converge on a small number of battle-tested implementations.

**Proof aggregation** is maturing. SHARP, Aligned Layer, and NEBRA demonstrate that aggregation can reduce per-proof verification costs by 10-100x. But aggregation services are themselves centralization points that need their own governance and security analysis.

The net picture: Layer 7 is the layer where the mathematical elegance of Layers 1 through 6 collides with the messy realities of software deployment, economic incentives, governance design, and human judgment. The cryptography is strong. The implementations are getting stronger. But the governance -- the social layer that determines who can change the software that checks the math -- remains the binding constraint on the security that zero-knowledge proofs can actually deliver to end users.

Until the governance matures to Stage 2 -- until the smart contracts that verify proofs are either immutable or governed by mechanisms that provably resist capture -- the verdict remains provisional. The audience is competent. The math checks out. But the audience serves at the pleasure of a committee that can replace it at any time.

Layer 7 is the last layer. The seven-layer tour -- from setup ceremony to on-chain verdict -- is complete. But zero-knowledge proofs do not operate in isolation. They belong to a family of privacy-enhancing technologies -- MPC, FHE, differential privacy, TEEs -- and understanding ZKPs without understanding their siblings leads to architectures that reach for the right mathematics and solve the wrong problem. Before we synthesize the seven layers in Part III, we map the family.
