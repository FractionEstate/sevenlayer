# Cryptographic Primitives and Hardness Assumptions

This document covers Layer 6: discrete-log, hash-based, and lattice-based security assumptions; commitment schemes; field choices; and the post-quantum transition.

## The Laws That Break

Richard Feynman liked to say that the laws of physics do not change. You can test them in New York or on the moon, today or in a billion years, and you get the same answers. The constants are constant. The symmetries hold. Nature does not update its firmware.

Zero-knowledge proof systems have their own "laws of physics" -- mathematical assumptions about which problems are hard to solve. These assumptions sit beneath every layer we have examined so far. The setup ceremonies of Layer 1, the constraint systems of Layer 4, the proof engines of Layer 5 -- all of them rest on a handful of beliefs about the difficulty of certain computations. If those beliefs are correct, the entire tower stands. If they are wrong, it collapses -- not gracefully, not partially, but completely.

Here is the uncomfortable question that Feynman would have asked, leaning forward with that half-grin that meant he had spotted something everyone else was politely ignoring: *What happens when quantum computers change these "laws"?*

Physics does not change. Mathematics does not change either. But our *assumptions* about which mathematical problems are hard -- those change whenever someone invents a better attack. And a quantum computer running Shor's algorithm is not a better attack. It is not a faster way to pick the same lock. It is a different kind of physics applied to the same mathematics, and it renders certain problems trivially easy that we have spent fifty years assuming were impossibly hard.

This chapter descends to the deepest layer of the zero-knowledge stack: the cryptographic primitives that everything else is built upon. It is about hardness assumptions, commitment schemes, finite fields, and the coming quantum reckoning. It is also about a revolution in progress -- a shift from one family of mathematical foundations to another that may dissolve what looked like permanent tradeoffs.

Here the metaphor reaches its limit. We cannot avoid the mathematics. But we can make it concrete. Every abstraction in this chapter corresponds to a specific engineering choice made by real teams building real systems. When we say "the Goldilocks field," we mean a specific 64-bit prime number. When we say "Module-SIS," we mean a specific problem involving short vectors in high-dimensional lattices. The goal is not to teach the mathematics but to explain why these choices matter and what they cost.

## Three Hardness Assumptions, Three Worlds

Every cryptographic system rests on a *hardness assumption*: a belief that a specific mathematical problem cannot be solved efficiently. The entire security guarantee is conditional. "This proof system is sound" really means "this proof system is sound *assuming* that problem X is hard." If someone finds a fast algorithm for problem X, the security guarantee vanishes. Not slowly. Immediately.

There is a useful way to think about this. A hardness assumption is like a combination lock. Classical computers try every combination one at a time -- for a lock with a trillion trillion combinations, they will never finish. Quantum computers do not try faster. They exploit the lock's internal structure to narrow the possibilities. Shor's algorithm does exactly this to the discrete logarithm problem: it uses quantum interference to find the answer directly. The lock opens. For hash-based problems, quantum computers get a modest advantage but the lock still holds if you make it big enough. For lattice problems (Module-SIS), no one has found a quantum trick that exploits the lock's structure at all. The tumblers do not vibrate. The lock holds.

Three hardness assumptions dominate zero-knowledge cryptography. Each creates a different world of possibilities and constraints.

### The Discrete Logarithm Problem

The oldest and most widely deployed assumption. Given a number $g$ and a value $h = g^x$, find $x$. On ordinary computers, the best known algorithms require roughly $2^{128}$ operations for carefully chosen groups -- effectively impossible. This assumption powers all elliptic curve cryptography, which in turn powers KZG commitments, Groth16 proofs, PLONK, and every pairing-based SNARK.

The DLP (Discrete Logarithm Problem -- the mathematical puzzle of figuring out how many times a number was multiplied by itself to produce a given result, which is easy to state but very hard to solve) world offers deep algebraic richness. Elliptic curve groups have a bilinear pairing operation -- a special function that takes two curve points and produces an element in a "target group." This pairing is the engine behind KZG polynomial commitments, which produce constant-size proofs (a single curve point, about 48 bytes) and enable constant-time verification (one pairing check). Nothing else in cryptography achieves this combination of succinctness and speed.

The cost is existential. A quantum computer running Shor's algorithm solves the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time. Not "might solve" -- *does solve*, given enough qubits. The DLP world has an expiration date. We do not know the day. But the clock is ticking, and the hands do not run backward.

### Collision-Resistant Hash Functions

A completely different kind of assumption. A hash function takes arbitrary input and produces a fixed-size output. "Collision resistance" means it is hard to find two different inputs that produce the same output. SHA-256, BLAKE3, and Poseidon are all collision-resistant hash functions (we believe).

The CRHF world is simpler and more conservative. Hash functions require no algebraic structure -- no groups, no pairings, no special number theory. This simplicity is both a strength (fewer assumptions to break) and a weakness (fewer mathematical tools to work with). FRI-based commitment schemes and STARKs live in this world. They are transparent (no trusted setup) and plausibly post-quantum, since hash functions are not broken by Shor's algorithm.

But "plausibly post-quantum" deserves scrutiny, and scrutiny reveals cracks. Grover's algorithm gives a quantum computer a quadratic speedup for brute-force search, halving the effective security level of hash preimage resistance: a 256-bit hash drops to 128-bit quantum security. More subtly, the BHT algorithm (Brassard-Hoyer-Tapp) can reduce collision resistance by a factor of three: SHA-256's 128-bit classical collision resistance becomes roughly 85-bit quantum collision resistance, though this attack requires impractical amounts of quantum random-access memory. And the FRI protocol's post-quantum security depends on the soundness of the Fiat-Shamir transform in the quantum random oracle model -- a reduction that is known but carries non-tight security bounds.

The honest statement is that hash-based systems *probably* survive quantum computers with appropriate parameter adjustments, but the unqualified claim that they are "post-quantum secure" gives false confidence. Intellectual honesty demands we say: this is not yet fully understood.

### Module-SIS (Module Short Integer Solution)

The newest and most mathematically demanding assumption. Given a matrix $M$ over a polynomial ring, find a short nonzero vector $z$ such that $M \cdot z = 0$. "Short" means the coefficients of $z$ are small. The best known algorithms (both classical and quantum) require exponential time for properly chosen parameters.

Module-SIS is the foundation of lattice-based cryptography -- the family that the post-quantum community has rallied around. NIST's post-quantum standards (FIPS 203, 204, and 205, published August 2024) are built on lattice problems. The assumption has been studied for over two decades, and no quantum algorithm significantly outperforms classical ones against it.

The lattice world offers a distinctive property: *module homomorphism*. An Ajtai commitment (the lattice analogue of a Pedersen commitment -- a Pedersen commitment is a cryptographic method for "sealing" a number using elliptic curve arithmetic, so the committed value can be verified later but cannot be changed after commitment) satisfies the equation $\rho \cdot \text{Com}(Z) = \text{Com}(\rho \cdot Z)$, where $\rho$ is a ring element. This is the algebraic structure that makes lattice-based folding schemes possible. It is weaker than what pairings provide (no bilinear map to a target group) but stronger than what hash functions provide (which have no algebraic structure at all).

The upshot is that lattice-based schemes occupy a useful middle ground: they have enough algebraic structure for folding and efficient composition, plus post-quantum security, plus transparent setup. Whether they can match the succinctness of pairing-based schemes is the open research question -- and the answer is converging toward "close enough."

## Four Families of Commitment Schemes

The hardness assumptions crystallize into concrete cryptographic tools called *polynomial commitment schemes*. A commitment scheme lets a prover "seal" a polynomial into a short commitment, then later prove that the polynomial evaluates to a specific value at a specific point. This is the mechanism that makes zero-knowledge proofs work -- it is how the prover demonstrates knowledge without revealing the underlying data.

Four families dominate. Each inherits the properties and limitations of its underlying assumption, the way a building inherits the geology of the ground it stands on.

### KZG (Kate-Zaverucha-Goldberg)

Built on the DLP and the bilinear pairing. The prover commits to a polynomial $p(x)$ as a single elliptic curve point $C = g^{p(s)}$, where $s$ is a secret from a trusted setup ceremony (the "powers of tau"). To prove that $p(z) = y$, the prover produces a single group element -- an evaluation proof -- that the verifier checks with one pairing operation.

KZG is the gold standard for succinctness. Proof size: constant, roughly 48 bytes on BLS12-381 regardless of polynomial degree. Verification time: constant, one pairing check. These are numbers that no other scheme matches. They are, in a precise mathematical sense, optimal.

The costs are equally clear. KZG requires a trusted setup -- a structured reference string generated by a multi-party computation ceremony. At least one participant must honestly destroy their secret contribution, or the entire system can be broken. The ceremony for Ethereum's EIP-4844 drew the six-figure participant count described in Chapter 2. And KZG is not post-quantum: Shor's algorithm breaks the pairing assumption along with the DLP.

KZG powers Groth16, PLONK, Marlin, and virtually every pairing-based SNARK. It is used by Midnight, Zcash, most Ethereum rollups (at the final verification layer), and the EIP-4844 blob commitment scheme.

To understand what a polynomial commitment *feels like*, consider what it accomplishes. A polynomial of degree $n$ encodes $n + 1$ independent values -- it is, in a precise sense, a compressed representation of an entire dataset. A polynomial of degree one million contains a million pieces of information. KZG seals all of that information into a single elliptic curve point: 48 bytes. One point on a curve, and behind it, a million values, invisible but committed. Later, anyone can ask "what does the polynomial evaluate to at point $z$?" and the prover produces a single additional curve point as proof. Not a proof proportional to the polynomial's size. Not a proof that grows with the complexity of the claim. A single point. Constant size. Whether the polynomial has degree ten or degree ten million, the proof is 48 bytes.

This is, in a precise mathematical sense, miraculous. It is worth pausing to feel the weight of that claim, because no amount of familiarity should make it seem ordinary.

The miracle rests on the bilinear pairing -- a function $e(P, Q)$ that takes two elliptic curve points and produces an element in a target group, satisfying $e(aP, bQ) = e(P, Q)^{ab}$. This bilinearity allows the verifier to check polynomial relationships without ever seeing the polynomial. The proof that $p(z) = y$ consists of a commitment to the quotient polynomial $q(x) = (p(x) - y) / (x - z)$. The verifier checks one equation: $e(C - yG, H) = e(\pi, H_s - zH)$, where $C$ is the commitment, $\pi$ is the proof, and $H_s$ is a point from the trusted setup encoding the secret $s$. If the equation holds, the polynomial evaluates to $y$ at $z$. If it does not, the prover is lying. One equation. Two pairing evaluations. Done.

The trusted setup deserves its own intuition. Think of it as a ruler with markings at positions $s, s^2, s^3, \ldots, s^n$, where $s$ is a secret that no one knows. The ruler is published as a sequence of elliptic curve points: $g, g^s, g^{s^2}, \ldots, g^{s^n}$. Anyone can use these markings to "measure" polynomial evaluations -- to compute $g^{p(s)}$ for any polynomial $p$ by combining the markings with the polynomial's coefficients. But no one can recover $s$ itself, because extracting $s$ from $g^s$ requires solving the discrete logarithm.

The analogy is not casual. It captures the essential structure: the SRS is a set of calibrated instruments whose internal workings are opaque but whose external behavior is perfectly reliable. You do not need to know the secret to use the ruler. You need to trust that someone built the ruler honestly -- that the markings correspond to genuine powers of a single unknown $s$, and that $s$ was destroyed after construction. This is the trust assumption that the multi-party ceremony enforces. If even one participant destroys their contribution, the ruler is sound. If all participants collude (or are compromised), they can forge proofs. The ceremony scales trust across thousands of independent parties, diluting the assumption to its practical vanishing point.

The mathematical miracle, then, is this: pairings allow you to verify claims about a polynomial you have never seen, committed in a form that reveals nothing about its coefficients, using a ruler whose markings you cannot read but whose geometry you can trust. Constant-size commitments. Constant-size proofs. Constant-time verification. These three constants are the reason KZG has dominated practical zero-knowledge for half a decade, and they are the benchmark against which every alternative scheme is measured.

### FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity)

Built on collision-resistant hashing alone. FRI tests whether a function (represented as a table of evaluations) is close to the evaluations of a low-degree polynomial. It works by recursive "folding" -- halving the domain at each step and checking consistency via random linear combinations, with Merkle trees providing the commitment structure.

FRI proofs are transparent (no trusted setup) and plausibly post-quantum (security from hashing, not from algebraic structure). Proof sizes are polylogarithmic -- $O(\log^2 n)$ in theory, typically 50 to 200 kilobytes in practice. This is orders of magnitude larger than KZG's 48 bytes, but the absence of a trusted setup and the quantum resistance are compelling compensations.

FRI is the commitment scheme inside every STARK: StarkWare's Stwo, Polygon's Plonky2 and Plonky3, SP1 Hypercube, and RISC Zero. It works best over fields with large multiplicative subgroups of order $2^k$, which is why STARK-friendly fields like Goldilocks and BabyBear exist.

The limitation: FRI has no algebraic homomorphism. You cannot add two FRI commitments and get a commitment to the sum of the polynomials. This means FRI cannot support folding directly, which is why STARK systems use recursion (proving that a proof is valid) rather than folding (combining two claims into one).

The intuition behind FRI is proximity testing, and it deserves a concrete picture. Suppose you have a table of values -- say, $2^{20}$ entries -- and you claim these values are the evaluations of a polynomial of degree at most $2^{10}$. In other words, you claim there exists a smooth, low-degree curve that passes through all million-odd points. FRI's job is to test that claim without reading the entire table.

Here is how it works. Imagine the claimed polynomial plotted on a graph -- a smooth curve undulating through a million points on the horizontal axis. FRI asks: "Is this really a smooth low-degree curve, or is it a jagged high-degree impostor that happens to agree with a low-degree polynomial at most points?" The test proceeds by *folding*. The verifier sends a random challenge $\alpha$. The prover uses $\alpha$ to combine pairs of evaluations: for each point $x$ in the domain, the prover computes a new value from $f(x)$ and $f(-x)$, weighted by $\alpha$. This produces a new table of half the size, over a domain of half the width. If the original function was degree $d$, the folded function has degree $d/2$.

Now repeat. Another random challenge. Another folding. The domain halves again. The degree halves again. Each round is a "zoom in" -- the verifier is looking at the function at finer and finer resolution, checking whether the smoothness persists. If the original function was truly a low-degree polynomial, every zoomed-in version remains smooth. The degree drops: $2^{10}$, then $2^9$, then $2^8$, all the way down to a constant. At the end, the prover reveals the final polynomial directly -- it is small enough to check by inspection.

But if the original function was *not* close to a low-degree polynomial -- if it was a high-degree impostor with hidden bumps -- then folding amplifies the bumps. Each round of folding, guided by the random challenge, mixes pairs of evaluations in a way that smooths genuine structure but destabilizes imposture. The bumps do not cancel; they compound. By the time you have zoomed in far enough, the remaining function is visibly not low-degree. The impostor is caught.

The commitment mechanism is beautifully simple: Merkle trees. The prover commits to each round's evaluation table by hashing it into a Merkle tree and publishing the root. When the verifier wants to spot-check specific points, the prover opens Merkle paths -- logarithmic-sized authentication paths from leaf to root. The security rests entirely on collision resistance of the hash function. No group structure, no pairings, no discrete logs. Just hashing.

This is why FRI replaces elliptic curves with hash functions. A Merkle tree commitment to $n$ evaluations costs $O(n)$ hashes to build and $O(\log n)$ hashes to open a single leaf. The total proof consists of Merkle roots (one per FRI round), Merkle paths (for the queried positions), and the final constant polynomial. The result is polylogarithmic: $O(\log^2 n)$ in total size, typically 50 to 200 kilobytes. Enormously larger than KZG's 48 bytes. But transparent. Plausibly post-quantum. And built from the simplest, most conservative cryptographic primitive we have: the hash function.

The tradeoff crystallizes the philosophical divide in zero-knowledge cryptography. KZG achieves its miracle of constant-size proofs by leveraging deep algebraic structure -- bilinear pairings over elliptic curves, with all the trust assumptions and quantum vulnerabilities that entails. FRI achieves transparency and quantum plausibility by abandoning that structure entirely, accepting larger proofs as the price. Neither choice is wrong. Each is a coherent answer to a different question about what you are willing to assume and what you are willing to pay.

### IPA / Bulletproofs (Inner Product Argument)

Built on the discrete logarithm problem without pairings. Bulletproofs use Pedersen commitments -- a simpler construction than KZG that does not require bilinear maps. The key insight is an inner product argument: prove that the inner product of two committed vectors equals a claimed value, using a recursive halving protocol that produces $O(\log n)$ group elements.

IPA proofs are transparent (no trusted setup, just a random group element generator). Proof sizes are logarithmic -- much smaller than FRI, but not constant like KZG. Verification, however, requires $O(n)$ work -- linear in the statement size. This is the main drawback: the verifier is slow.

Halo (2019) proved that IPA-based schemes support recursion without pairings, using a technique called "nested amortization" that defers expensive verification across recursion steps. This was the conceptual breakthrough that opened the door to transparent recursive proving. Halo2 powers Zcash's Orchard protocol and influenced the design of the Pasta curves (Pallas and Vesta).

The limitation: IPA is not post-quantum. It still relies on the discrete logarithm assumption. And the linear verification cost makes it impractical for on-chain verification without wrapping in a more succinct outer proof.

The inner product argument deserves to be understood on its own terms, because it is one of the most elegant constructions in modern cryptography. The problem it solves is this: you have committed to two vectors $\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{b}$ of length $n$, and you claim their inner product is some value $c$. You want to prove this claim without revealing the vectors. The naive approach would require the verifier to reconstruct the entire inner product -- $n$ multiplications, $n - 1$ additions, linear work. The inner product argument reduces this to logarithmic work.

The technique is recursive halving. Split both vectors into their left and right halves: $\mathbf{a} = (\mathbf{a_L}, \mathbf{a_R})$ and $\mathbf{b} = (\mathbf{b_L}, \mathbf{b_R})$. Compute two "cross-terms": $L = \text{Commit}(\mathbf{a_L}, \mathbf{b_R})$ and $R = \text{Commit}(\mathbf{a_R}, \mathbf{b_L})$. Publish $L$ and $R$. The verifier sends a random challenge $x$. Both parties compute new vectors: $\mathbf{a'} = x \cdot \mathbf{a_L} + x^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{a_R}$ and $\mathbf{b'} = x^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{b_L} + x \cdot \mathbf{b_R}$. The new vectors have half the length. The new inner product claim can be derived from the old one plus the cross-terms. Repeat.

Each halving adds exactly two group elements ($L$ and $R$) to the proof. For vectors of length $n = 2^{20}$ -- roughly a million entries -- the protocol runs for 20 rounds, producing 40 group elements. At 32 bytes per element on a 256-bit curve, that is 1,280 bytes. A proof that two million-entry vectors have a specific dot product, in 1.3 kilobytes. Not constant like KZG. But logarithmic, transparent, and no trusted setup.

This is why Halo was a watershed. Before Halo, recursive proof composition required pairings -- you needed the bilinear map to verify a KZG proof inside a circuit, and that meant you needed pairing-friendly curves, which meant you needed a trusted setup. Halo demonstrated that IPA's logarithmic proofs could be verified *incrementally* across recursion steps, deferring the expensive linear-time final check. The key was nested amortization: instead of verifying the IPA proof fully at each recursion step (which would cost linear time and destroy the efficiency), Halo accumulated the verification work and deferred it to the end. This meant each recursion step added only constant overhead, and the full linear verification happened once, at the very end of the recursion chain.

The result was the first recursive proof system with no trusted setup and no pairings. It required a cycle of curves -- Pallas and Vesta, the "Pasta" curves, each one's scalar field being the other's base field -- but no ceremony, no toxic waste, no trust assumptions beyond the hardness of the discrete logarithm. Zcash adopted Halo2 for its Orchard shielded pool, replacing the Sprout and Sapling ceremonies with transparent recursion. The ceremony was over. The mathematics was enough.

### Lattice / Ajtai Commitments

Built on Module-SIS. The Ajtai commitment scheme works over a cyclotomic ring $R_q = \mathbb{F}_q[X]/(\Phi(X))$. To commit to a vector $Z$, compute $\text{Com}(Z) = M \cdot Z$ where $M$ is a public random matrix over the ring. The binding property reduces to the Module-SIS problem: forging a commitment requires finding a short vector in a lattice.

Lattice commitments are transparent (the matrix $M$ is generated from public randomness) and post-quantum (Module-SIS resists quantum attacks). Proof sizes are logarithmic -- $O(\log n)$ ring elements, concretely 50 to 60 kilobytes for current parameterizations.

The key algebraic property: Ajtai commitments are *module-homomorphic* over the ring. For a ring element $\rho$ and a commitment $\text{Com}(Z)$, you get $\rho \cdot \text{Com}(Z) = \text{Com}(\rho \cdot Z)$. This is strictly richer than scalar homomorphism and is what enables lattice-based folding. The challenges used in folding are ring elements from a carefully chosen "strong sampling set" with small coefficients, which controls the norm growth of folded witnesses.

Lattice commitments power Greyhound, LaBRADOR, LatticeFold, LatticeFold+, Neo, and Symphony. They are the youngest family and the least battle-tested in production, but they are the only family that simultaneously offers post-quantum security, algebraic structure sufficient for folding, and transparent setup.

The geometry of the short vector problem rewards intuition. Imagine a forest of trees planted in a perfectly regular grid -- rows and columns spaced exactly one meter apart, stretching to the horizon in every direction. You are dropped at a random point in this forest. Finding the nearest tree is trivial: you can see the grid, feel its regularity, walk to the closest intersection. Now imagine the same forest, but the grid has been distorted. The trees are no longer evenly spaced. The rows curve. The columns tilt. The local pattern near any tree looks regular, but the global structure is scrambled by a "bad" basis -- a set of directions that are long, nearly parallel, and unhelpful for navigation. You can still see trees around you, but finding the *nearest* tree -- the closest lattice point to your position -- has become exponentially hard. You wander among trees that look close but are not closest. The geometry of the lattice hides the answer in plain sight.

This is the Closest Vector Problem, and its computational cousin the Shortest Vector Problem, on which Module-SIS rests. The matrix $M$ in the Ajtai commitment defines the lattice. The "short vector" condition -- finding $z$ such that $M \cdot z = 0$ and each component of $z$ is bounded by a parameter $\beta$ -- is the lattice analogue of finding that nearest tree. The commitment to a message $m$ uses randomness $r$: $\text{commit} = M \cdot [m;\, r]$. Binding holds because finding two different $(m, r)$ pairs that produce the same commitment requires finding a short difference vector -- a short element in the kernel of $M$. If the lattice is properly parameterized (high dimension, appropriate modulus), no efficient algorithm can find such a vector.

Why do lattices resist quantum computers? The answer is structural. Shor's algorithm exploits *periodicity*. The discrete logarithm problem has a hidden periodic structure: given $g^x$, the function $f(a, b) = g^a \cdot h^b$ is periodic with period related to $x$. Shor's quantum Fourier transform finds this period efficiently. Lattice problems have no such periodicity. The Closest Vector Problem is not periodic -- it is geometric. The difficulty comes from the high dimensionality and the scrambled basis, not from any hidden algebraic cycle. Grover's algorithm provides a generic quadratic speedup for unstructured search (turning $2^{128}$ into $2^{64}$), but lattice algorithms are not brute-force searches. The best lattice algorithms (BKZ and its variants) operate by finding short vectors in projected sublattices, and no quantum algorithm significantly accelerates this process. The lattice estimator -- the standard tool for selecting parameters -- accounts for Grover's quadratic speedup and still produces comfortable security margins. Neo's 127-bit post-quantum security, for instance, already incorporates the best known quantum attacks.

The Module-SIS formulation adds one more layer. Instead of vectors over a field, you work with vectors over a polynomial ring $R_q = \mathbb{F}_q[X]/(\Phi(X))$. Each "entry" in the vector is itself a polynomial -- a ring element with $d$ coefficients. This means a vector of length $\kappa$ over the ring actually contains $\kappa \cdot d$ field elements, giving the lattice its high dimension. The module structure is what provides the algebraic homomorphism: because the ring has multiplication, the commitment scheme inherits module-homomorphic properties that a plain integer lattice would not provide. It is this marriage of lattice hardness and ring algebra that makes the entire folding program possible.

## The Trilemma -- And Its Dissolution

The original paper presented a "cryptographic primitives trilemma": a claim that any commitment scheme can achieve at most two of three desirable properties.

1. **Algebraic functionality** -- the homomorphic structure needed for folding, composition, and efficient recursive proving.
2. **Post-quantum security** -- resilience against quantum computers running Shor's and Grover's algorithms.
3. **Succinctness** -- small proofs and fast verification.

The trilemma positioned the four families like this:

- **KZG** achieves algebraic functionality and succinctness but lacks post-quantum security.
- **FRI** achieves post-quantum security but lacks algebraic functionality (no homomorphism, so no folding) and offers only moderate succinctness (large proofs).
- **IPA** achieves moderate algebraic functionality but lacks both post-quantum security and full succinctness (linear verification).
- **Lattice** achieves algebraic functionality and post-quantum security. Succinctness is the remaining gap.

This framing was useful as a historical snapshot. As a statement of permanent truth, it is increasingly wrong.

The lattice revolution -- Greyhound (2024), LatticeFold (2024), LatticeFold+ (2025), Neo (2025), Symphony (2026) -- has been systematically closing the succinctness gap. Greyhound demonstrated 50-kilobyte proofs with sublinear verification. LaBRADOR achieved 58-kilobyte proofs for large constraint systems. Symphony's high-arity folding can compress a final proof via a compact SNARK that, if instantiated with a pairing-based scheme, produces constant-size output -- and if instantiated with a lattice-based scheme, remains fully post-quantum.

The trilemma is better understood as a *spectrum* that is being actively compressed. The engineering challenge is real (lattice proofs are still 1000x larger than KZG), but the trajectory is clear: lattice schemes are approaching practical competitiveness, and the gap shrinks with each generation. What looked like a permanent constraint on the geometry of the design space is turning out to be an artifact of our current engineering, not a law of mathematical nature.

To see the trilemma clearly, state the three properties any polynomial commitment scheme would ideally achieve:

1. **Small proofs, constant size.** The proof should not grow with the size of the polynomial. Ideally, one group element or a fixed number of bytes, regardless of degree.
2. **Fast verification, constant time.** The verifier's work should not depend on the polynomial's complexity. Ideally, a single algebraic check.
3. **No trusted setup, transparent.** The scheme should require no ceremony, no toxic waste, no trust assumptions beyond the hardness of a mathematical problem.

No known scheme achieves all three. KZG achieves the first two but requires a trusted setup ceremony. FRI achieves the third (transparent) and offers reasonable verification (polylogarithmic), but its proofs are polylogarithmic rather than constant -- orders of magnitude larger. IPA achieves the third (transparent) with logarithmic proofs (impressively small), but its verification is linear -- the verifier must do work proportional to the polynomial's degree. Lattice commitments achieve the third (transparent) with logarithmic proofs, but verification is sublinear rather than constant.

The question that should keep a mathematician awake at night is: *is this trilemma fundamental?* Is there a theorem -- an impossibility result, an information-theoretic lower bound -- proving that no commitment scheme can simultaneously achieve constant-size proofs, constant-time verification, and transparency?

The answer, as of 2026, is no. No one has proven that the ideal PCS is impossible. The barriers are engineering barriers, not mathematical barriers. The bilinear pairing that gives KZG its constant-size miracle is a specific algebraic structure tied to elliptic curves, and elliptic curves require structured reference strings to exploit pairings. But nothing in information theory says that constant-size polynomial commitments *require* pairings. Nothing says that transparency *requires* large proofs. The ideal scheme -- transparent, constant-size, constant-verification, post-quantum -- remains the field's holy grail. It may not exist. But its impossibility has not been proven, and the gap between what lattice schemes achieve today and what that grail demands shrinks with every new construction. The trilemma may be less a law of nature than a confession of our current ignorance.

## Small Fields

If the commitment scheme is the "which family" decision, the finite field is the "which numbers" decision. And this choice -- seemingly a detail buried deep in the mathematics -- turns out to determine nearly everything about performance.

A finite field is a set of numbers equipped with addition and multiplication that "wrap around" at a fixed boundary, called the *modulus* or *prime*. Every value in a zero-knowledge circuit is an element of some finite field. Every arithmetic operation is performed modulo the field's prime. The choice of prime cascades upward through every layer of the system. It is one of those decisions that seems technical and narrow when you make it, and then turns out to have been the most important decision you made.

### The Old World: BN254 and BLS12-381

For most of the 2010s, the ZK world standardized on two large primes:

**BN254** (Barreto-Naehrig curve, 254-bit prime). This was the first widely deployed pairing-friendly curve. Ethereum embedded BN254 pairing operations as EVM precompiles in 2017, making it the de facto standard for on-chain Groth16 verification. Every deployed Groth16 verifier on Ethereum -- including those used by the major rollups -- runs over BN254.

**BLS12-381** (Barreto-Lynn-Scott curve, ~253-bit prime). Introduced later with a higher security margin and better pairing efficiency. Used by Zcash, Filecoin, Midnight, and the Ethereum KZG ceremony (EIP-4844).

Both are enormous primes -- 254 and 253 bits respectively. Arithmetic on 254-bit numbers requires multiple machine words on any existing processor. A single multiplication takes several CPU instructions and cannot exploit the native 32-bit or 64-bit arithmetic units that modern hardware is optimized for.

### The Security Erosion Problem

BN254 was originally believed to provide 128-bit security -- meaning an attacker would need roughly $2^{128}$ operations to break the discrete logarithm. But advances in the Tower Number Field Sieve (Tower NFS) [Kim and Barbulescu, "Extended Tower Number Field Sieve," Mathematics of Computation, 2016; Guillevic, "Comparing the pairing efficiency over composite-order and prime-order elliptic curves," ACNS 2013] have revised this estimate downward to approximately 100 bits. This does not mean BN254 is broken -- $2^{100}$ operations is still astronomically expensive -- but it means the security margin is significantly thinner than designed.

This matters because BN254 is embedded in Ethereum's EVM precompiles. Changing the precompiled curves requires a hard fork. Every Groth16 verifier on Ethereum depends on BN254. The security erosion is not academic -- it affects the most widely deployed zero-knowledge infrastructure in the world.

BLS12-381 is not affected by Tower NFS and retains its 128-bit security estimate. But it is also not immune to future cryptanalytic advances. And neither curve survives a quantum computer.

### The New World: BabyBear, M31, Goldilocks

Starting around 2022, a radical idea took hold: *use much smaller primes*.

**BabyBear** ($p = 2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1$, a 31-bit prime). Fits in a single 32-bit machine word. Arithmetic is native on every modern CPU and GPU. Used by RISC Zero and Plonky3.

**Mersenne-31 / M31** ($p = 2^{31} - 1$, a 31-bit Mersenne prime). The simplest possible arithmetic -- reduction modulo a Mersenne prime is a single addition. Used by StarkWare's Stwo and Circle STARKs.

**Goldilocks** ($p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$, a 64-bit prime). Fits in a single 64-bit machine word. Has high 2-adicity ($2^{32}$ divides $p - 1$), enabling efficient FFTs with domain sizes up to $2^{32}$. Used by Polygon's Plonky2 and by Neo/Nightstream.

The performance impact is not incremental. It is a factor of 100. Arithmetic on 31-bit numbers is roughly 100 times faster than arithmetic on 254-bit numbers [Haboeck, Levit, and Papini, "Circle STARKs," ePrint 2024/278; confirmed by SP1 Hypercube benchmarks, Succinct Labs, 2025]. This is not algorithmic improvement -- it is the raw physics of computer hardware. A 31-bit multiply is one CPU instruction. A 254-bit multiply is an entire subroutine involving carry propagation, multi-limb multiplication, and modular reduction.

This single insight -- that smaller fields make faster provers -- catalyzed the performance explosion in zero-knowledge proving. Circle STARKs over M31 (Stwo) achieve throughputs that were unimaginable with BN254-based systems. Plonky2 over Goldilocks enabled the first practical recursive STARKs.

But smaller fields introduce a subtlety that Penrose would appreciate for its geometric elegance. A single 31-bit field element provides only 31 bits of security against certain attacks. To achieve 128-bit security, systems use *extension fields*. An extension field is built by the same trick as complex numbers: you take a small field and add extra "dimensions" to your arithmetic, and the security grows with the dimension. The cost is slightly more expensive arithmetic per operation -- but each operation now works in a larger, more secure space -- enlarging $\mathbb{F}_p$ to $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ for some small $k$. In Stwo, the extension degree is 4, giving effectively 124 bits. In Neo, the extension is $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ over Goldilocks, giving 128 bits. The extension adds complexity but the arithmetic is still vastly cheaper than native 254-bit operations.

### Why This Choice Is a One-Way Door

The field choice is perhaps the most consequential "one-way door" decision in zero-knowledge system design. It cascades through every layer:

- The field determines which commitment schemes are efficient (pairing-friendly fields for KZG, STARK-friendly fields for FRI, cyclotomic fields for lattice schemes).
- The commitment scheme determines which proof systems work (KZG enables Groth16/PLONK, FRI enables STARKs, Ajtai enables lattice folding).
- The proof system determines the arithmetization format (PLONK gates, AIR, CCS).
- The arithmetization determines which programs can be efficiently proved.

Changing the field after deployment means rewriting the compiler, the prover, the verifier, the standard library, and every circuit. It is not a parameter change. It is a complete system redesign.

## The Quantum Threat Horizon

The question is not whether quantum computers will break DLP-based cryptography. The question is when.

### What Shor's Algorithm Does

Shor's algorithm, published in 1994, solves the discrete logarithm problem in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Given $g$ and $h = g^x$, it finds $x$ using roughly $O(n^3)$ quantum gates, where $n$ is the bit length of the group order. For BLS12-381, this requires approximately 2,500 logical qubits. Each logical qubit requires thousands of physical qubits for error correction, meaning the actual hardware requirement is on the order of millions of physical qubits -- roughly three orders of magnitude beyond current devices, which have demonstrated only a few thousand physical qubits.

When a cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) exists, the consequences are immediate and total:

- Every KZG commitment ever published becomes forgeable.
- Every Groth16 proof ever verified becomes suspect.
- Every elliptic curve signature (including BLS signatures and ECDSA) breaks.
- Every Pedersen commitment loses its binding property.
- Every system built on pairing-based cryptography fails simultaneously.

The failure mode is not gradual degradation. It is a cliff. One day the lock holds. The next day every lock of that type, everywhere, opens at once.

### The Timeline

Estimates for when a CRQC will exist vary widely:

- **Optimistic (Forrester, 2024):** "Q-Day" by 2030.
- **Conservative (academic consensus):** 2032-2035.
- **NIST IR 8547 (November 2024):** Recommends that all federal agencies deprecate pre-quantum cryptographic algorithms by 2035.

NIST's position is the most policy-relevant. In August 2024, NIST published three post-quantum cryptography standards: FIPS 203 (ML-KEM, a key encapsulation mechanism based on Module-LWE), FIPS 204 (ML-DSA, a digital signature based on Module-LWE), and FIPS 205 (SLH-DSA, a stateless hash-based signature). These are not draft standards or proposals -- they are finalized, mandatory standards for federal systems.

The IR 8547 guidance document sets a deadline: by 2035, federal systems must have migrated away from RSA, ECDSA, and all DLP-based cryptography. The reasoning is straightforward: if a CRQC arrives in 2035 and a migration takes 5-10 years, you need to start migrating now.

### The HNDL Threat

The most insidious quantum threat is not future code-breaking but present data collection. "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) describes the strategy of recording encrypted communications today for decryption by future quantum computers. A Federal Reserve discussion paper (FEDS 2025-093) explicitly identified HNDL as a risk to financial infrastructure.

For zero-knowledge systems, the HNDL analogue is this: an adversary records all on-chain data -- commitments, proofs, public inputs -- today, waiting for a quantum computer to extract the underlying secrets. In a system like Zcash or Midnight, where commitments hide transaction amounts and sender/receiver identities, a future CRQC could retroactively de-anonymize the entire transaction history.

The concern is not theoretical. The blockchain is a permanent, public record. Nothing posted to Ethereum or any other blockchain can be deleted. Every BLS12-381 commitment, every BN254 proof, every elliptic curve public key is preserved forever, waiting. The data is patient. A quantum computer needs only to be built once.

### Deployed Systems at Risk

Any zero-knowledge system deployed today that relies on DLP-based cryptography faces a choice:

1. **Accept the expiration date.** Acknowledge that the system's security guarantees have a finite lifespan and plan accordingly. This is the pragmatic approach for systems that do not require long-term privacy (e.g., rollups where the transactions are already publicly visible).

2. **Migrate proactively.** Begin transitioning to post-quantum primitives before a CRQC exists. This is the only option for systems that provide long-term privacy guarantees (e.g., shielded transactions, confidential identity systems).

3. **Ignore the problem.** Hope that quantum computers take longer than expected, or that "crypto-agility" will allow a rapid migration when the time comes. This is the most common approach -- and the most dangerous, because "crypto-agility" in practice means "complete architectural redesign."

## Lattice-Based Proving

Against this backdrop -- the ticking clock, the harvest-now threat, the cliff edge -- a research program has been steadily building an alternative: lattice-based zero-knowledge proof systems that provide post-quantum security without sacrificing the algebraic structure needed for efficient proving.

The progression has been fast, compressing a decade of typical cryptographic development into two years.

### Stage 1: Greyhound (2024)

The first demonstration that lattice-based SNARKs could be practical, not just theoretical. Greyhound achieved approximately 50-kilobyte proofs with sublinear (square root of N) verification, built entirely on Module-SIS. It was a standalone SNARK, not a folding scheme -- a proof of concept that lattice proofs could fit in the same order of magnitude as STARK proofs.

### Stage 2: LatticeFold (2024)

The conceptual breakthrough. Dan Boneh and Binyi Chen adapted Nova-style folding to work over cyclotomic rings with Ajtai commitments. The key insight: Ajtai's module homomorphism is the lattice analogue of Pedersen's additive homomorphism, and it is sufficient to enable the random-linear-combination technique that makes folding work.

LatticeFold introduced three composable reductions -- $\Pi_{\text{CCS}}$ (constraint satisfaction to evaluation claims), $\Pi_{\text{RLC}}$ (random linear combination), and $\Pi_{\text{DEC}}$ (decomposition to control norm growth) -- that together form a complete folding scheme for CCS (Customizable Constraint Systems).

But LatticeFold had a critical limitation. It was restricted to power-of-two cyclotomic polynomials of the form $X^d + 1$. Over the Goldilocks field, this polynomial splits completely into degree-1 factors, meaning each NTT slot has only 64-bit security -- insufficient for the 128-bit target.

### Stage 3: LatticeFold+ (2025)

A comprehensive improvement: 5 to 10 times faster prover, simpler verification circuit, shorter folding proofs, and a new purely algebraic range proof replacing LaBRADOR's more complex approach. LatticeFold+ identified three concrete parameterizations, including one over Goldilocks with the 81st cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_{81} = X^{54} + X^{27} + 1$. This polynomial does not split into linear factors over Goldilocks; instead, it factors into degree-2 irreducibles, giving the extension field $K = \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with 128-bit NTT slots.

LatticeFold+ also introduced a general composition theorem: if one reduction is "phi-restricted" with restricted knowledge soundness, and another is "phi-relaxed" knowledge sound, their composition is knowledge sound. This provided the formal foundation for chaining reductions.

### Stage 4: Neo (2025)

Neo overcame LatticeFold's power-of-two limitation directly. Its central innovation is the *rotation matrix encoding* -- the "bar transform" -- which represents ring elements as rotation matrices in a commutative subring of the matrix ring. The map sends a ring element $a$ in $R_q$ to a $d \times d$ matrix $\text{rot}(a)$, and this map is a ring isomorphism. The payoff: the matrix commitment scheme becomes S-homomorphic: $\text{rot}(\rho) \cdot \text{Com}(Z) = \text{Com}(\text{rot}(\rho) \cdot Z)$.

Neo works natively over Goldilocks with $\Phi_{81}$, giving $d = 54$, $\kappa = 16$, $m = 2^{24}$, and 127-bit post-quantum security (verified via the standard lattice estimator). The guard condition $(k+1) \cdot T \cdot (b-1) = 2{,}808 < 4{,}096 = B$ ensures that norm growth remains bounded across arbitrarily many folding steps.

### Stage 5: Symphony (2026)

The most ambitious design. Symphony pushes folding to high arity -- folding 1,024 or more instances in a single step, rather than the standard two. This eliminates the need for recursive IVC (which requires embedding hash verification inside the SNARK circuit, a major overhead). Symphony folds $\text{poly}(\lambda)$ NP statements into two committed linear statements in one shot, then proves these with a compact SNARK.

Symphony also introduces approximate range proofs (replacing the exact norm proofs of LatticeFold+), reducing verification complexity further. Its concrete instantiation can handle $2^{32}$ R1CS constraints -- over four billion -- in a single batch.

If Symphony's compact SNARK is instantiated with a pairing-based scheme (Groth16), the final proof is constant-size. If instantiated with a lattice-based scheme, the entire pipeline is post-quantum. This modularity is the architectural insight: separate the bulk proving (which must be post-quantum) from the final compression (which can optionally use classical tools for maximum succinctness).

### The Key Algebraic Insight

The entire lattice folding line rests on a single algebraic fact that deserves to be stated plainly, because it is the kind of fact that sounds narrow but turns out to govern everything.

An Ajtai commitment over the ring $R_q$ is *module-homomorphic*. This means that for any challenge element $\rho$ drawn from a strong sampling set with small coefficients, the equation $\rho \cdot \text{Com}(Z) = \text{Com}(\rho \cdot Z)$ holds. This is the lattice analogue of the scalar homomorphism that makes Nova-style folding work over elliptic curves.

But the lattice version is richer. The challenge $\rho$ is not a scalar but a *ring element* -- equivalently, a $d \times d$ rotation matrix. This richer structure enables three things simultaneously:

1. **Folding with norm control.** Challenges from the strong sampling set $\mathcal{C}$ have small coefficients (in $\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}$ for Neo), so the folded witness grows slowly in norm.
2. **Sum-check compatibility.** Ring evaluation claims can be verified via the sum-check protocol over the base field, connecting the commitment layer to the constraint satisfaction layer.
3. **Decomposition.** The accumulated norm can be reduced back to the base bound $b$ via bit-decomposition, enabling unbounded recursion without norm blowup.

This algebraic trifecta -- homomorphism, sum-check compatibility, and decomposition -- is what makes lattice-based folding possible. It is the "deep craft" of Layer 6: not a single clever trick, but an interlocking set of algebraic properties that together provide something no other family offers. The geometry of the lattice (its distances, its short vectors, its algebraic symmetries) does the work that pairings do in the elliptic curve world, but without the quantum vulnerability.

---

## Case Study: Midnight

To see how Layer 6 choices play out in a real system, consider Midnight -- a privacy-focused blockchain built by Input Output Global (IOG), the company behind Cardano. Midnight makes every choice from the pairing-based, pre-quantum playbook. The consequences cascade through every layer.

### The Stack

**Scalar field:** BLS12-381, with a ~253-bit prime modulus $r$. Every value in Midnight's zero-knowledge circuits -- inputs, outputs, intermediate computations, token balances -- is an element of $\mathbb{F}_r$.

**Commitment scheme:** KZG, implied by the choice of BLS12-381 (a pairing-friendly curve). The wallet SDK caches BLS parameters locally (a structured reference string from a trusted setup ceremony). Proof size is constant. Verification is a single pairing check.

**Embedded curve:** Jubjub, a twisted Edwards curve whose order divides $r$. Jubjub lives "inside" BLS12-381's scalar field, enabling efficient elliptic curve operations (point addition, scalar multiplication, hash-to-curve) within zero-knowledge circuits without the overhead of non-native field arithmetic.

**Hash functions:** Poseidon-family algebraic hashes, represented at the ZKIR level as opaque opcodes (`transient_hash`, `persistent_hash`, `hash_to_curve`). Algebraic hash functions are dramatically more efficient inside ZK circuits than traditional hash functions like SHA-256, because their operations (field additions and multiplications) are native to the circuit's arithmetic.

**Token model:** UTXO-based shielded tokens (similar to Zcash Sapling). A coin is a triple (nonce, color, value) committed to a global Merkle tree via `persistent_hash`. Nullifiers prevent double-spending. Pedersen commitments on Jubjub hide transaction values.

### What Midnight Gets

Midnight occupies the "high algebraic functionality + high succinctness" corner of the design space. The pairing enables constant-size KZG proofs. Jubjub enables rich in-circuit elliptic curve operations (key derivation, Pedersen commitments, hash-to-curve) with native efficiency. The PLONK-like proof system compiles from a purpose-built language (Compact) through a 24-opcode instruction set (ZKIR). The standard library provides Merkle trees, shielded token circuits, and a full Zswap protocol for private token transfers.

The result is maximum algebraic functionality. Every cryptographic primitive -- hashing, commitment, key derivation, signature verification -- operates natively within the circuit's arithmetic. Nothing requires emulation or non-native field arithmetic.

### What Midnight Gives Up

Post-quantum resilience: none. Every component of Midnight's cryptographic stack depends on either the discrete logarithm problem (Jubjub key derivation, Pedersen commitments) or pairing-based assumptions (KZG proof verification). Shor's algorithm breaks all of it.

The vulnerability assessment is total:

| Component | Assumption | Post-Quantum Status |
|---|---|---|
| Proof verification (KZG) | q-SDH on BLS12-381 | Broken by Shor |
| Jubjub key derivation | ECDLP on Jubjub | Broken by Shor |
| Pedersen commitments | DLP on Jubjub | Broken by Shor (binding fails) |
| In-circuit hashing | CRHF (Poseidon) | Weakened but likely survivable |
| Merkle tree roots | CRHF | Likely survivable |
| Nullifiers | PRF | Likely survivable |

The proof system is the deepest vulnerability. Even if Midnight replaced its Pedersen commitments with hash-based constructions, and even if it switched from Jubjub key derivation to a lattice-based signature scheme, the proof verification mechanism is fundamentally tied to the BLS12-381 pairing. Changing it would require replacing KZG with a different commitment scheme, which would require changing the field, which would require rewriting the compiler, the standard library, the prover, the verifier, and the wallet SDK.

The one-way-door property is in full force. Midnight's choice of BLS12-381 is not a parameter that can be updated. It is the foundation on which every other component is built. A post-quantum migration for Midnight would not be an upgrade. It would be a new system.

### Midnight vs. Neo: Opposite Corners

The contrast with Neo/Nightstream makes the tradeoffs vivid:

| Dimension | Midnight | Neo/Nightstream |
|---|---|---|
| Field | BLS12-381, ~253 bits | Goldilocks, 64 bits |
| Ring | N/A (field-based) | $\mathbb{F}_q[X]/(\Phi_{81})$, degree 54 |
| Commitment | KZG (pairing) | Ajtai (lattice) |
| Hash | Poseidon (algebraic) | Ring-SIS (lattice) |
| Proof size | $O(1)$ curve points | $O(\log n)$ ring elements |
| PQ secure | No | Yes (127-bit) |
| EC in-circuit | Yes (Jubjub, native) | No (would need circuit emulation) |
| Trusted setup | Yes (powers-of-tau) | No |

Neo trades Midnight's in-circuit elliptic curve operations and constant-size proofs for post-quantum security, transparent setup, and a simpler recursive architecture (no curve cycles needed). Neither system dominates on every dimension. The question is which tradeoffs matter more for your threat model and time horizon.

For a system deployed today that needs maximum on-chain efficiency and whose privacy guarantees are measured in years (not decades), Midnight's choices are defensible. For a system that needs to protect sensitive data for 15 or more years, or that must comply with NIST's 2035 deprecation timeline, Neo's choices are the only viable path.

---

## The Cascade Effect

The deeper lesson of Layer 6 is that it is not really a "layer" at all. It is a foundation. Every choice made here propagates upward through the entire stack with the force of mathematical necessity.

Consider Neo's parameter cascade:

```
Field: Goldilocks (q = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1)
  --> Ring: Phi_81, degree d = 54
    --> Commitment: kappa = 16 rows, m = 2^24 columns
      --> Folding: b = 2 (base), k = 12 (decomposition depth), B = 4096 (norm bound)
        --> Challenge: T = 216 (expansion factor), |C| ~ 2^125
          --> Security: 127-bit MSIS
            --> Guard: (k+1) * T * (b-1) = 2,808 < 4,096 = B
```

Change any parameter and everything downstream shifts. Use a different prime and the cyclotomic factorization changes, which changes the extension field, which changes the security level, which changes the commitment parameters, which changes the folding parameters. This is not optional coupling -- it is algebraic necessity. The parameters are not chosen independently. They are derived from each other, each one a consequence of the ones above it, the way the shape of a crystal is a consequence of the geometry of its atoms.

The same cascade operates in the pairing world. BLS12-381's prime determines the Jubjub embedding. Jubjub determines which in-circuit operations are efficient. The pairing determines which commitment scheme works. The commitment scheme determines the proof system. The proof system determines the arithmetization.

And so "crypto-agility" -- the ability to swap cryptographic primitives without redesigning the system -- is largely a fiction for zero-knowledge systems. You cannot change the field without changing everything. The choice at Layer 6 is a one-way door, and once you walk through it, you are committed.

To make this concrete, here is the decision tree that every zero-knowledge system architect walks, whether they realize it or not.

**If you choose BabyBear (31-bit prime, $p = 2^{31} - 2^{27} + 1$):** You get SIMD-friendly arithmetic -- four field multiplications packed into a single 128-bit SIMD instruction, eight into a 256-bit AVX2 register. Your natural commitment scheme is FRI, because BabyBear has a multiplicative subgroup of order $2^{27}$, large enough for practical NTT domains. Your constraint format is AIR (Algebraic Intermediate Representation) or CCS, depending on your proof system. Your setup is transparent -- no ceremony, no trust. Your proofs are large (50 to 200 kilobytes) but your prover is *fast*, because every arithmetic operation is a single machine instruction. You achieve 128-bit security via a degree-4 extension field (four BabyBear elements per extended element, giving ~124 bits). This is the path chosen by RISC Zero and Plonky3. It optimizes for prover throughput at the cost of proof size.

**If you choose Goldilocks (64-bit prime, $p = 2^{64} - 2^{32} + 1$):** You get native 64-bit arithmetic -- one multiplication per CPU instruction, no multi-limb overhead. Your natural commitment scheme is FRI (exploiting 2-adicity of $2^{32}$ for large NTT domains) or lattice-based Ajtai commitments (using the 81st cyclotomic polynomial for post-quantum security). Your constraint format is CCS or R1CS. Your setup is transparent in either case. If you choose FRI, your proofs are large but your prover leverages GPU-friendly 64-bit arithmetic. If you choose Ajtai, you get post-quantum security and folding capability, with proofs in the 50 to 60 kilobyte range. This is the path chosen by Plonky2 (FRI) and Neo/Nightstream (Ajtai). It balances prover speed, proof size, and -- if lattice-based -- quantum resilience.

**If you choose BLS12-381 (254-bit pairing-friendly curve):** You get the full power of bilinear pairings -- KZG commitments with constant-size proofs (48 bytes), constant-time verification (one pairing check), and the richest algebraic structure available. Your constraint format is PLONKish gates or R1CS. Your setup requires a trusted ceremony (powers-of-tau). Your proofs are the smallest in existence. But your arithmetic is the most expensive: a single 254-bit multiplication costs a multi-limb subroutine that is 100 times slower than BabyBear's native operation. And you inherit an expiration date: Shor's algorithm will break every pairing-based proof when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives. This is the path chosen by Midnight, Zcash (pre-Orchard), every Ethereum rollup's final verification layer, and the EIP-4844 blob scheme. It optimizes for proof succinctness and verifier efficiency at the cost of prover performance and quantum resilience.

**If you choose Mersenne-31 ($p = 2^{31} - 1$):** You get the simplest possible modular reduction -- subtraction of the carry bit, because $2^{31} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. Your commitment scheme is FRI, adapted via Circle STARKs to work with M31's multiplicative group structure (which lacks large 2-adic subgroups but has a circle group of order $2^{31}$). Your prover is the fastest in existence for STARK-based systems, because M31 arithmetic is cheaper than any other field. Your proofs are transparent and plausibly post-quantum. This is StarkWare's Stwo path -- maximum prover throughput, hash-based security, no algebraic frills.

Each path is internally consistent. Each forecloses the others. You cannot start down the BabyBear path and switch to KZG midstream -- the field does not support pairings. You cannot start with BLS12-381 and add post-quantum security -- the algebraic structure that gives you constant-size proofs is the same structure that Shor's algorithm destroys. The decision tree is not a menu. It is a set of branching tunnels, and once you enter one, the others seal behind you.

---

## Algebraic vs. Traditional Hash Functions

One more Layer 6 choice deserves attention, because it illustrates how deeply the primitive selection affects practical performance.

**Traditional hash functions** (SHA-256, BLAKE3, Keccak) are designed for speed on general-purpose hardware. Their internal operations -- bitwise rotations, XOR, addition with carry -- are cheap on CPUs but extremely expensive inside zero-knowledge circuits, because the circuit's native operations are field additions and multiplications. Proving a single SHA-256 computation inside a SNARK requires tens of thousands of constraints.

**Algebraic hash functions** (Poseidon, Poseidon2, Rescue, Griffin) are designed for the opposite environment. Their internal operations are field multiplications and exponentiations -- exactly the operations that are native to zero-knowledge circuits. A Poseidon hash inside a circuit costs hundreds of constraints instead of tens of thousands.

The performance difference is 100x or more. This is why every system that does significant hashing inside circuits (Merkle tree verification, Fiat-Shamir challenges, commitment randomness) either uses algebraic hashes or pays an enormous performance penalty.

But algebraic hashes are newer and less studied than SHA-256 or BLAKE3. Their security rests on assumptions about the difficulty of algebraic attacks (Grobner basis computations, interpolation attacks) that have not endured decades of cryptanalysis. Poseidon, in particular, has seen several parameter revisions in response to improved attacks.

The choice between algebraic and traditional hash functions is itself a Layer 6 decision that cascades upward. Midnight uses Poseidon-family hashes (maximizing in-circuit efficiency at the cost of less mature security analysis). STARK-based systems can use either, but algebraic hashes dramatically reduce the size of the verification circuit when recursion or wrapping is needed.

---

## The Structural Advantage of Lattices

One insight from the lattice revolution deserves emphasis because it is easy to miss amid the parameter details: **lattice-based schemes are architecturally simpler** than their pairing-based predecessors, not just quantum-resistant.

Pre-quantum recursive proof systems (exemplified by Zexe) require:

- **Cycles of elliptic curves.** To verify a proof inside another proof, the verifier's field arithmetic must be efficient in the prover's circuit. This requires two curves whose scalar fields are each other's base fields -- a "cycle." Finding such cycles constrains parameter choices severely, and arithmetic on the second curve is typically 2x or more expensive.

- **Non-native field arithmetic.** When the proof system operates over one field but the verifier checks computations in another, every operation must be emulated using multi-precision arithmetic inside the circuit. This is a major source of overhead.

- **Multiple structured reference strings.** Each curve in the cycle needs its own trusted setup, doubling the ceremony burden.

Lattice-based folding eliminates all three requirements. Neo operates over a single ring $R_q$. The rotation matrix encoding makes everything native to one algebraic structure. Recursion via folding requires no curve cycles and no non-native arithmetic. The setup is transparent (public random matrix).

This simplification is not cosmetic. Fewer moving parts mean fewer places for bugs, fewer parameters to choose and validate, fewer assumptions to audit. The lattice path is not only quantum-resistant -- it is *simpler*. And in cryptographic engineering, simplicity is not a luxury. It is a security property.

---

## Maturity and Readiness

As of early 2026, the picture looks like this:

**Deployed and battle-tested:** KZG (BN254 and BLS12-381), FRI/STARK (Goldilocks, BabyBear, M31), IPA/Bulletproofs (Pasta curves). These power every production ZK system -- Ethereum rollups, Zcash, Midnight, Starknet.

**Peer-reviewed and prototyped:** LatticeFold (ASIACRYPT 2025, presentation by Boneh and Chen), LatticeFold+ (CRYPTO 2025). Neo has an active implementation in Rust (the Nightstream repository, 15 crates). Concrete benchmarks are emerging but sparse.

**Proposed and promising:** Symphony (ePrint 2025/1905, no implementation yet). The high-arity folding concept is validated theoretically but awaits engineering.

**Standards in place:** NIST FIPS 203/204/205 (August 2024) standardize lattice-based key encapsulation and signatures. No standard yet exists for lattice-based zero-knowledge proof systems, but the parameter selection methodology (the lattice estimator) is well established.

The adoption trajectory suggests lattice-based proof systems will move from research prototypes to production-ready systems in 2026-2027, with Neo/Nightstream among the first to target production deployment.

---

## The One-Way Door

Layer 6 is unlike any other layer in the stack. Layers above it can be upgraded, swapped, and optimized. A rollup can change its sequencer, rewrite its compiler, switch arithmetization formats, even adopt a new proof system -- all without changing the cryptographic foundations. But the foundations themselves are effectively permanent.

For architects making this one-way decision, the following rubric distills the tradeoffs:

| Field | Size | PQ Status | Commitment Options | Sweet Spot |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| BN254 | 254-bit | Quantum-vulnerable | KZG (cheapest EVM verification) | Legacy Ethereum rollups; Groth16 wrapper |
| BLS12-381 | 253-bit | Quantum-vulnerable | KZG (higher security margin) | Privacy systems needing pairings (Midnight, Zcash) |
| BabyBear | 31-bit | Hash-PQ; lattice-PQ | FRI, Ajtai | Maximum prover speed; RISC-V zkVMs (SP1, RISC Zero) |
| Mersenne-31 | 31-bit | Hash-PQ | FRI (Circle STARK) | Fastest arithmetic; Stwo/Starknet ecosystem |

The finite field determines the commitment scheme. The commitment scheme determines the proof system family. The hardness assumption determines the security lifespan. These choices are made once, at the beginning, and they propagate upward through every component with the inexorability of mathematical structure.

This is why the quantum threat is not a problem that can be deferred until quantum computers actually exist. A system deployed in 2026 with BN254 foundations will still be running in 2036. If a CRQC arrives in 2035, that system will have spent its final years accumulating a public record of commitments and proofs that can be retroactively broken. The HNDL threat means the privacy guarantees were never real -- they were deferred revelations, secrets written in ink that merely required a light that had not yet been invented.

The lattice revolution is a construction project, not an academic exercise. It is building new foundations that can support the same architectural weight as pairing-based cryptography -- folding, recursion, efficient composition -- without the quantum expiration date. The trilemma that seemed permanent is being dissolved not by discovering new mathematics but by engineering better constructions from mathematics that has existed for decades.

The laws of physics do not change. But our understanding of which mathematical problems are hard does change, and a quantum computer represents a discontinuous shift in that understanding. The systems that survive will be the ones whose foundations were chosen with that shift in mind.

The physical laws are set. The field is chosen, the commitment scheme determined, the hardness assumption staked. Everything from here upward -- the proof system, the arithmetization, the language, the setup -- inherits the possibilities and constraints of this foundation. But none of it matters until someone checks the proof. Layer 7 is where the mathematics meets its audience: on a blockchain, in a smart contract, through a governance structure that can override everything we have built. The next chapter examines the verdict -- and the uncomfortable truth that the audience's judgment is only as trustworthy as the institution that seats them.
